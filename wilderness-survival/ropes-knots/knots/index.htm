The variety of knots, bends, bights, and hitches is almost endless. These classes of knots are intended only as a general guide since some of  the knots discussed may be appropriate in more than one class. The skill of knot tying can perish if not used and practiced. With experience and practice, knot tying becomes instinctive and helps the mountaineer in many situations.</p>
 
<h4>Square Knot</h4>
<p>The square knot is used to tie the ends of two ropes of equal diameter (Figure 4-6). It is a joining knot.</p>

<h4>Bowline</h4>
<p>The bowline is used to tie the end of a rope around an anchor. It may also be used to tie a single fixed loop in the end of a rope (Figure 4-11). It is an anchor knot.</p>
<dir>
<p>a. <strong>Tying the Knot.</strong></p>  
<dir>
<p> STEP 1. Bring the working end of the rope around the anchor, from right to left (as the climber faces the anchor).</p>
<p> STEP 2. Form an overhand loop in the standing part of the rope (on the climber’s right) toward the anchor.</p>
 
<p> STEP 3. Reach through the loop and pull up a bight.</p>
<p> STEP 4. Place the working end of the rope (on the climber’s left) through the bight, and bring it back onto itself. Now dress the knot down.</p>
<p> STEP 5. Form an overhand knot with the tail from the bight.</p>

</dir>
<h4>Round Turn and Two Half Hitches</h4>
<p>This knot is used to tie the end of a rope to an anchor, and it must have constant tension (Figure 4-12). It is an anchor knot.</p>
<dir>
<p>a. <strong>Tying the Knot.</strong></p>  
 
<dir>
<p> STEP 1. Route the rope around the anchor from right to left and wrap down (must have two wraps in the rear of the anchor, and one in the front). Run the loop around the object to provide 360-degree contact, distributing the load over the anchor.</p>
<p> STEP 2. Bring the working end of the rope left to right and over the standing part, forming a half hitch (first half hitch).</p>
<p> STEP 3. Repeat STEP 2 (last half hitch has a 4 inch pigtail).</p>
<p> STEP 4. Dress the knot down.</p>
</dir>
</dir>
<p align="center"><img src="..\..\mountain-graphics\fig4-12.gif" width="504" height="189" alt="Figure 4-12. Round turn and two half hitches."></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-12. Round turn and two half hitches.</strong></p>
 
 <dir>
<p>b. <strong>Checkpoints.</strong></p>
<dir>
<p>(1) A complete round turn should exist around the anchor with no crosses.</p>
<p>(2) Two half hitches should be held in place by a diagonal locking bar with no less than a 4-inch pigtail remaining.</p>
</dir>
</dir>
<h4>Figure-Eight Retrace (Rerouted Figure-Eight)</h4>
<p>The figure-eight retrace knot produces the same result as a figure-eight loop. However, by tying the knot in a retrace, it can be used to fasten the rope to trees or to places where the loop cannot be used (Figure 4-13). It is also called a rerouted figure-eight and is an anchor knot.</p>
 
<dir>
<p>a. <strong>Tying the Knot.</strong></p>  
<dir>
<p> STEP 1. Use a length of rope long enough to go around the anchor, leaving enough rope to work with.</p>
<p> STEP 2. Tie a figure-eight knot in the standing part of the rope, leaving enough rope to go around the anchor. To tie a figure-eight knot form a loop in the rope, wrap the working end around the standing part, and route the working end through the loop. The finished knot is dressed loosely.</p>
<p> STEP 3. Take the working end around the anchor point.</p>
<p> STEP 4. With the working end, insert the rope back through the loop of the knot in reverse.</p>
 
<p> STEP 5. Keep the original figure eight as the outside rope and retrace the knot around the wrap and back to the long-standing part.</p>
<p> STEP 6. Remove all unnecessary twists and crossovers; dress the knot down.</p>

<p>(2) There is a minimum 4-inch pigtail.</p>
</dir>
</dir>
<h4>Clove Hitch</h4>
<p>The clove hitch is an anchor knot that can be used in the middle of the rope as well as at the end (Figure 4-14). The knot must have constant tension on it once tied to prevent slipping. It can be used as either an anchor or middle of the rope knot, depending on how it is tied.</p>
<dir>
<p>a. <strong>Tying the Knot.</strong></p>
<dir>
 
<p>(1) <strong><em>Middle of the Rope.</em></strong></p>  
<dir>
<p> STEP 1. Hold rope in both hands, palms down with hands together. Slide the left hand to the left from 20 to 25 centimeters.</p>
<p> STEP 2. Form a loop away from and back toward the right.</p>
<p> STEP 3. Slide the right hand from 20 to 25 centimeters to the right. Form a loop inward and back to the left hand.</p>
<p> STEP 4. Place the left loop on top of the right loop. Place both loops over the anchor and pull both ends of the rope in opposite directions. The knot is tied.</p>  
</dir>
 
<p>(2) <strong><em>End of the Rope.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructional purposes, assume that the anchor is horizontal.</p>
<dir>
<p> STEP 1. Place 76 centimeters of rope over the top of the anchor. Hold the standing end in the left hand. With the right hand, reach under the horizontal anchor, grasp the working end, and bring it inward.</p>
<p> STEP 2. Place the working end of the rope over the standing end (to form a loop). Hold the loop in the left hand. Place the working end over the anchor from 20 to 25 centimeters to the left of the loop.</p>
<p> STEP 3. With the right hand, reach down to the left hand side of the loop under the anchor. Grasp the working end of the rope. Bring the working end up and outward.</p>
 
<p> STEP 4. Dress down the knot.</p>
</dir>

<h4>Wireman's Knot</h4>
<p>The wireman’s knot forms a single, fixed loop in the middle of the rope (Figure 4-15). It is a middle rope knot.</p>
<dir>
<p>a. <strong>Tying the Knot.</strong></p>  
 
<dir>
<p> STEP 1. When tying this knot, face the anchor that the tie-off system will be tied to. Take up the slack from the anchor, and wrap two turns around the left hand (palm up) from left to right.</p>
<p> STEP 2. A loop of 30 centimeters is taken up in the second round turn to create the fixed loop of the knot.</p>
<p> STEP 3. Name the wraps from the palm to the fingertips: heel, palm, and fingertip.</p>
<p> STEP 4. Secure the palm wrap with the right thumb and forefinger, and place it over the heel wrap.</p>
<p> STEP 5. Secure the heel wrap and place it over the fingertip wrap.</p>
<p> STEP 6. Secure the fingertip wrap and place it over the palm wrap.</p>
 
<p> STEP 7. Secure the palm wrap and pull up to form a fixed loop.</p>
<p> STEP 8. Dress the knot down by pulling on the fixed loop and the two working ends.</p>
<p> STEP 9. Pull the working ends apart to finish the knot.</p>

<p>b. <strong>Checkpoints.</strong></p>
 
<dir>
<p>(1) The completed knot should have four separate bights locking down on themselves with the fixed loop exiting from the top of the knot and laying toward the near side anchor point.</p>
<p>(2) Both ends should exit opposite each other without any bends.</p>
</dir>
</dir>
<h4>Directional Figure-Eight</h4>
<p>The directional figure-eight knot forms a single, fixed loop in the middle of the rope that lays back along the standing part of the rope (Figure 4-16). It is a middle rope knot.</p>
<dir>
<p>a. <strong>Tying the Knot.</strong></p>  
 
<dir>
<p> STEP 1. Face the far side anchor so that when the knot is tied, it lays inward.</p>
<p> STEP 2. Lay the rope from the far side anchor over the left palm. Make one wrap around the palm.</p>
<p> STEP 3. With the wrap thus formed, tie a figure-eight knot around the standing part that leads to the far side anchor.</p>
<p> STEP 4. When dressing the knot down, the tail and the bight must be together.</p>

<dir>
<p>a. <strong>Tying the Knot.</strong></p>
<dir>
 
<p>(1) <strong><em>Middle-of-the-Rope Prusik.</em></strong> The middle-of-the-rope Prusik knot can be tied with a short rope to a long rope as follows (Figure 4-20.):</p>  
<dir>
<p> STEP 1. Double the short rope, forming a bight, with the working ends even. Lay it over the long rope so that the closed end of the bight is 12 inches below the long rope and the remaining part of the rope (working ends) is the closest to the climber; spread the working end apart.</p>
<p> STEP 2. Reach down through the 12-inch bight. Pull up both of the working ends and lay them over the long rope. Repeat this process making sure that the working ends pass in the middle of the first two wraps. Now there are four wraps and a locking bar working across them on the long rope.</p>
<p> STEP 3. Dress the wraps and locking bar down to ensure they are tight and not twisted. Tying an overhand knot with both ropes will prevent the knot from slipping during periods of variable tension.</p>
