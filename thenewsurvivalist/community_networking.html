        because we have been able to stick together forming groups, clans, tribes,

        you are, you will probably have little chance against a gang of marauding 
        vandals and bandits intent upon taking your possessions, and possibly 
        your life. If you ban together with your neighbors for your mutual defense 
        your chances for survival will increase greatly. <font color="#000066"><b>No

      for people to live their entire lives in the same communities in which they 
      had been born. Everyone knew their neighbors, many even since childhood. 
      Today we live in a highly mobile society.</font> By next year your present 
      neighbor may have moved across the country and you may never see him or 
      her again. To make matters even worse, thanks to the internet, we may spend 
      more time communicating with people on the other side of the planet than 
      with those who live on the same street. We also spend more time in front 
      of the television than at community events. All of this has tended to alienate 
      us from our neighbors. It is not uncommon today for people to live for years 
      next to neighbors whom they have never met.</td>

      much more likely to help a friend than a stranger. </font>It is also easier 
      to barter with people with whom you have already established good rapport. 
      Part of your survival plans should include getting to know as many of your 
      neighbors as possible. If you need an icebreaker, share the bounty from 
      your garden or orchard. Bag up some of your extra produce and give it to 
      your neighbors. If you do not at present have produce from your garden, 
      bake a cake or a batch of cookies, or take them a sample of your home canning. 
      Welcome new neighbors with a dish, a dessert, or a jar of your home canning. 
      Participate in local and community events whenever possible. Turn off the 
      television and spend more time on the front porch. Organize a weekly poker 
      game. Make your neighbors your friends.</td>

      <p><font size="+1">Once you have become well acquainted with your neighbors, 
        there may be one or more whom you will want to discuss preparedness with.</font> 
        They will be less likely to come knocking at your door for provisions 
        if they have put away provisions of their own. But no matter how well 
        you get to know your neighbors, you should keep the full extent of your 
        survival stash a secret from all but your closest family members. Information 
        like that tends to spread very rapidly during times of extreme shortages, 
        and if you are not careful you could someday have strangers knocking at 
        your door or even breaking into your home. Regardless of your altruistic 
        tendencies, it will be impossible for you to provide for everyone. The 
        supplies that were supposed to last for months could disappear in as little 
        as a day or two. Take care of your family first. But cooperate with your 
        friends and neighbors whenever possible.</p>
      <p><b>Neighborhood Watches</b> are a great way to meet your neighbors, to 
        find out who else is awake and prepping, and to find out who you will 
        be able to count on in an emergency, and who you will not be able to count 
        on. <a href="http://www.usaonwatch.org/assets/publications/0_NW_Manual_1210.pdf" target="blank">Download</a> 
        materials from the internet and you will find that a large part of today's 
        neighborhood watches is disaster preparedness. Neighborhood watches are 
        a great excuse to get together with your neighbors once a month to talk 
        about preparedness. If there is not already an organized watch in your 
        neighborhood, <b>start one yourself! </b>That way you can have a lot of 
        influence on how yours is run. Organize monthly meetings where you will 
        cover a different preparedness topic each month.</p>

      for your welfare, but you will also be able to keep an eye on your local 
      politicians and get involved in their decisions <b>before</b> they pass 
      ordinances that threaten you (such as a city ordinance against home gardening, 
      which we are seeing more and more!) For too long, here in America, things 
      were going so well that we got lazy and started taking our liberties for 
      granted. We took our eyes off of government and then we woke up one day 
      in the realization that, while we were asleep, our government had been seized 
      by mega corporations who were busy establishing a control state and legislating 
      our liberties away. Many Americans are waking up today and saying, &quot;Not 
      on my watch!&quot; Although it may already be too late! </td>
