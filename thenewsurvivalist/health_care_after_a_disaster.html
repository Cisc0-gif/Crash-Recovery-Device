      <p><font size="+1">First aid by definition is that care rendered to a victim 
        before professional medical care arrives.</font> First aid classes are 
        structured with the assumption that an ambulance will soon be along with 
        paramedics who will take over, or that the victim will be taken to the 
        emergency room of a hospital where professionals will be waiting. But 
        people who have lived through disasters know that it doesn't always work 
        out that way. As we have seen, after a disaster, emergency responders 
        are usually overwhelmed. Depending on the extent of the emergency it may 
        take a considerable amount of time before you can get professional medical 
        care. This is where knowledge of <b>backwoods medicine</b> could prove 
        essential.</p>
      <p>Your first aid class will include a good first aid manual but it will 
        not include a manual for backwoods medicine. Fortunately there have been 
        some excellent books written on the subject by experienced medical doctors. 
        The <a title="Additional Resources" href="survival_resources.html">Additional 
        Resources</a> section at the end of this web site lists some that I recommend. 
        If your disaster preparedness plans include contingencies for prolonged 
        emergencies in which medical care may be unavailable for quite some time, 
        then I recommend that you purchase one of these books. Read it through 
        once to become familiar with the basics, and then keep it with your emergency 
        stash for future reference.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">First aid and backwoods medicine are both for the care 
        of injuries and emergencies. But there is another important part of medicine 
        that is often neglected by the conventional medical establishment, and 
        that is <b>preventative medicine</b>.</font> Even when conventional medicine 
        gives lip service to prevention, what they are usually talking about is 
        actually early detection (e.g., breast exams, prostate exams, blood pressure 
        screenings, etc.) <b>There is a huge difference between prevention and 
        early detection. The latter assumes that you already have the malady, 
        so there was really no prevention at all! </b></p>
      <p align="center"><b><font size="+1" color="#000066">&quot;An ounce of prevention 
        is worth a pound of cure.&quot; &#151;Benjamin Franklin</font></b></p>
      <p>Common sense tells us that it is better to prevent a disease than to 
        wait until it has a foothold and then attempt to cure it. For one thing, 
        by the time a cure is needed it may be too late, for many diseases are 
        incurable. Furthermore, attempts at a cure are usually much more difficult, 
        costly and dangerous.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">To learn about preventative health care you will need 
        to look outside the conventional medical establishment.</font> There are 
        many good books on the subject, including some that I have listed in <a title="Additional Resources" href="survival_resources.html">Additional 
        Resources</a>. I also recommend an online course called <b>Natural Health 
        School</b> which is located at <a href="http://www.theherbspecialist.com">http://www.theherbspecialist.com</a>. 
        You can complete the entire course online for free. (You do not need to 
        pay the voluntary fee unless you want the certificate of completion.) 
        The course is centered around nutritional products, but it also includes 
        a large amount of basic information about how the body works&#151;information 
        which I recommend for all lay people. It is very important that you have 
        a basic understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the human body. 
        Many doctor visits and unnecessary treatments can be prevented with this 
        simple empowering knowledge. The more you know the less dependent you 
        will be on organized medicine and the better prepared you will be to take 
        care of yourself and others during a prolonged emergency, when organized 
        medicine may be unavailable.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">We can all understand the importance of disease prevention. 
        But how much more important is prevention during a prolonged emergency, 
        when medical care may be difficult or impossible to come by? Good nutrition 
        is one of the most important steps that we can take to prevent disease.</font></p>
      <p>Some of the stores that you have already stashed away for an emergency 
        may be located in a place where you have given little thought. Your body 
        was designed by nature to store certain supplies that can be drawn upon 
        during an emergency. We all know (to the chagrin of many) that the body 
        stores calories, in the form of fat, that it can draw upon when food is 
        scarce. I am not recommending that you increase your fat reserves, unless 
        of course you are underweight, (in which case you certainly should.) But 
        what many don't realize is that the body also stores important nutrients, 
        including vitamins and minerals, that it can draw upon when our diets 
        are deficient.</p>
      <p>As we saw in the chapter on food, during a prolonged emergency our diets 
        will change, and probably not for the better. Most likely we will be eating 
        a less varied diet containing more foods that have been in storage. Some 
        nutrition is lost in any stored food, and the longer it has been stored 
        the more nutrition it will have lost. Furthermore, these dietary changes 
        occur at a time when we are under additional stress, which is when our 
        bodies draw upon our nutritional reserves the most. </p>

      <p> 
      <p> 
      <p><font size="+1">I recommend that your emergency supplies include a good 
        multivitamin/multimineral supplement, and perhaps a good calcium supplement 
        as well. </font>The calcium supplement should include the additional nutritional 
        factors that are necessary for adequate absorption and utilization of 
        calcium. The vitamin/mineral supplement that I use is <a target="blank" href="http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/products/product/stocknumber1792">Super 
        Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals</a>. Super Supplemental contains calcium, 
        but I think it is a good idea for most people to include additional calcium. 
        The calcium supplement I use is <a target="blank" href="http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/products/product/stocknumber3194">Calcium 
        Magnesium</a>. There may be another brand that you prefer. Just make sure 
        that it is a quality product, to maximize bioavailability, and that it 
        will store well. You should store enough to see you and your family through 
        the longest emergency that you foresee. This should not be a problem because 
        quality vitamins have a storage life of at least two years. They can still 
        be used long after their expiration dates but their potency will begin 
        to decline.</p>
      <p>In addition to stashing vitamins and minerals, it is very important that 
        you are regularly taking them now. Nutritionists and doctors tell us that 
        we should be doing this anyway to maintain and protect our health, especially 
        since our foods today are known to be deficient, due to modern processing 
        techniques and overly worked and depleted soils. But as a survivalist 
        you should also be regularly taking vitamins now to insure that your body's 
        internal stores of important nutrients will always be well stocked, so 
        that you will be ready for any emergency or disaster. This will also insure 
        that your supplement stash will be continually rotated and will therefore 
        remain fresh. It is extremely important that you rotate your supplements, 
        using the oldest stock first. When you buy more supplements always put 
        them at the back of your storage shelf pushing the older bottles toward 
        the front of the shelf so that they will be used first.</p>

      <p>If you choose to take the supplements that I have mentioned, during a 
        prolonged emergency it will be adequate to take one <a target="blank" href="http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/products/product/stocknumber1792">Super 
        Supplemental</a> and one <a target="blank" href="http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/products/product/stocknumber3194">Calcium 
        Magnesium</a> each day. Take them with your largest meal of the day to 
        insure maximum absorption. (The supplements I have chosen are highly absorbable, 
        but this is always good advice anyway.) During normal times when there 
        is no emergency, you should take one tablet of each supplement with every 
        meal, or at least two tablets of each supplement every day, taken with 
        your two largest meals of the day. This will insure that your body has 
        the nutrition it needs to keep its stores well stocked.</p>

      <p>A knowledge of the wild herbs that grow in your area could prove very 
        useful during a prolonged emergency, when supplies of food and medicine 
        are short. In the chapter on food I have already mentioned a couple of 
        my favorite herbs, including the ubiquitous dandelion. </p>

      <h4 align="left">Dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>)<br>
      </h4>
      <p>As we saw earlier, all parts of the dandelion can be used for food, with 
        the young leaves being particularly good in salads or as cooked greens. 
        Dandelion roots, roasted and ground, can serve as a coffee substitute. 
        But did you know that many herbalists also use dandelion as a medicine? 
        It is valued mostly for its benefits for the urinary and glandular systems 
        and as a liver and kidney tonic. Herbalists turn to dandelion for its 
        ability to enhance the efficiency of the body's eliminative and detoxifying 
        functions. It is a mild laxative and diuretic. It has traditionally been 
        used as a tonic, blood purifier, for constipation, inflammatory skin conditions, 
        joint pain, eczema, and liver dysfunction&#151;including liver conditions 
        such as hepatitis and jaundice. As a tonic dandelion strengthens the kidneys 
        and may be helpful for conditions such as water retention and high blood 
        pressure. (Great information to know if you suffer from high blood pressure, 
        especially if you can't get your medicine.) Dandelion does not deplete 
        the body of potassium like many diuretics. </p>

      <h4 align="left">Aloe Vera (<i>Aloe barbadensis</i>)<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Most people know it as the familiar house plant. Herbalists know aloe 
        vera as a cooling herb that is good for treating conditions in which there 
        is excess heat. It is commonly referred to as &quot;burn plant&quot; because 
        the clear juice contained in its thick meaty leaves can serve as a treatment 
        for minor burns including sun burns. The juice is also a great treatment 
        for other skin irritations including wounds and rashes. It can be used 
        for diaper rash, insect bites and stings, chicken pox itch, and for poison 
        ivy and poison oak. It may also be of some benefit for psoriasis and eczema. 
        Aloe vera juice can also be taken internally to treat conditions ranging 
        from arthritis to stomach and intestinal problems including ulcers. It 
        builds the immune system and is helpful for degenerative conditions. It 
        absorbs bowel toxins and is useful as a laxative. To prepare aloe vera 
        use a sharp knife to filet a leaf, removing the outer green part of the 
        leaf from the clear gel on the inside. Shortly after it is filleted an 
        enzyme in the leaf will begin to liquefy the gel. For internal use consume 
        several ounces of the juice at a time. Aloe vera is also rich nutritionally 
        and can be used as an emergency food. It must be used in moderation however 
        due to its laxative effect. It contains 18 amino acids, some B vitamins, 
        vitamin C, niacinamide, choline and other nutritional factors.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Whereas aloe vera is a &quot;cooling herb,&quot; ginger root is known 
        as a &quot;warming herb.&quot; Ginger root is of course an excellent spice 
        to use in your kitchen. It is an aromatic stimulant that improves appetite 
        and digestion. It has antimicrobial effects and can be used along with 
        salt, pepper and other spices for preserving meat as jerky. But ginger's 
        most notable feature is its ability to relieve nausea. It is more effective 
        than Dramamine for motion sickness. It can also be used in moderation 
        for morning sickness during pregnancy. Ginger may also be helpful in preventing 
        the onset of migraine headaches, especially those that start with nausea 
        or vertigo. Like aloe vera, ginger can be grown as a house plant. </p>

      <p>To grow ginger simply break off a piece of fresh ginger root, that you 
        will find in the produce section of your grocery store, and plant it in 
        a large flower pot. It will soon sprout leaves. When the leaves turn brown

      <p>The numerous health benefits of garlic have been known for centuries. 
        It is both an immune stimulant and one of the most powerful antibiotics 
        in the plant kingdom. Garlic can be taken to ward off colds and to treat 
        infections. It's benefits for the circulatory system are equally impressive 
        and have been well documented by medical research. Garlic is a powerful 
        blood thinner. It reduces risk for stroke, improves heart health and helps 
        normalize high blood pressure. If you can't get your blood thinner or 
        high blood pressure medication during an emergency, garlic may serve as 
        an effective substitute. </p>

      <p>Cayenne pepper is best known as the hot &quot;red pepper&quot; condiment. 
        It should go without saying that it is another &quot;warming herb.&quot; 
        It has antimicrobial action and is therefore another good spice to use 
        for preserving meat as jerky. Although most people are familiar with this 
        herb, few are aware of its many health benefits. Cayenne is rich in the 
        vitamins and minerals that help promote healing. Believe it or not cayenne 
        is also good for stomach conditions like ulcers because it stimulates 
        the production of the protective mucus that coats the stomach. Cayenne 
        improves circulation to the extremities which can help diabetics with 
        circulatory problems, including those who suffer from itching hands and 
        feet. Cayenne can be taken internally to stop a heart attack or used on 
        a regular basis to help prevent heart disease.</p>

      <p>Rose hips are the highly nutritious fruits or seed pods of roses. They 
        are usually red in color, have a delicious flavor similar to apples and 
        are famous for their vitamin C content. Three rose hips contain the same 
        amount of vitamin C as one orange. They are also rich in bioflavonoids 
        and other vitamins and minerals including A, B-complex, D, E, iron and 
        calcium. Rose hips are recommended for pregnant women to help them prepare 
        for labor and delivery, possibly reducing labor and recovery time. They 
        are also used to help prevent urinary bladder infections. Rose hips support 
        the immune system helping the body fight off colds and other illnesses. 
        They strengthen fragile blood vessels helping people who bruise easily 
        and those with varicose veins. Rose hips can also speed up the healing

      <p>Rose hips remain on the bush throughout the winter and can provide an 
        excellent free food when nearly all other outdoor food sources are gone. 
        They can be eaten right off the bush or dried and stored for later consumption. 
        Slice each rose hip in half, remove the central core of seeds and dry 
        the remaining pulp and skins for later use. Rose hips are usually reddish

      <h4>Echinacea (<i>Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea

      <p>I have always held the opinion that if you are going to plant something, 
        it might as well be something that you can eat or use as a medicine. Decorative 
        flowers are no exception. If I plant a flower in my yard, you can be sure 
        that I have some practical use in mind for it. I mentioned the nutritional 
        value of rose hips above. Another pretty flower that can serve a useful 
        function over and above its ornamental value is echinacea. Echinacea is 
        widely grown as an ornamental, but few are aware of its value as a medicine. 
        Echinacea root is an immune system stimulant, which means that it can 
        improve the efficiency of the immune system helping us prevent and recover 
        from illnesses quicker. Recently some medical &quot;authorities&quot; 
        (i.e., drug company cronies) have questioned the efficacy of echinacea 
        root, producing research that supposedly indicated that it has little 
        value in fighting infections. The problem with their research is they 
        were evaluating the herb as an antibiotic. Unlike garlic, echinacea does 
        not work directly on infective agents or germs, but rather by supporting 
        your own immune system, enhancing your natural defenses so your body can 
        prevent and fight off infections like it is supposed to.</p>

        It is native to the central and southwestern U.S. where it grows in open 
        fields and rocky soils where there is plenty of sunlight. It is a herbaceous 
        perennial, which means that it dies down each year only to return the

          side effects! The effects of Vitamin D3 supplementation are many, and 
          they are all beneficial! Better immune response and a more positive 
          mood are just two of the healthful benefits of taking Vitamin D3 during 
          the Winter season. </font>During the cold and flu season, we receive 
          much less sunlight to our bodies&#151;the primary natural source of 
          Vitamin D. The sun is lower in the sky and the sunlight that reaches 
          us has to pass through the Earth's atmosphere at an acute angle, increasing 
          the amount of atmosphere that it passes through which filters out much 
          of its healthful benefits. Low levels of Vitamin D3 are responsible 
          for poor immunity during the cold and flu season and are also linked 
          to SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder, or &quot;Winter Blues.&quot;) So 
          this year, avoid the dangerous flu shot, whose benefits are questionable 
          to say the least, and whose many hazards are well documented. Make <a target="blank" href="http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/product/vitamin-d3-60-tabs/1155/?upline=192734">Vitamin
