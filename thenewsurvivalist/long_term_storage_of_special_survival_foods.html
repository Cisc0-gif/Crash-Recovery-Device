      <p>Certain other foods, if stored properly, can keep for 5 to 10 years or 
        even longer. All stored foods should be dated so they can be rotated out 
        when the time comes to replace them.<br>
        Other cereals, such as oats<br>
        Dried Beans<br>
        Dried Corn<br>
        Rice<br>
        Couscous<br>
        Whole Spices</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Before I discuss the best way to store these foods, lets 
        take a brief moment to review the major reasons why stored foods spoil.</font> 
        Food is spoiled primarily by the growth of microorganisms. In order to 
        grow and reproduce, most microorganism require two things, water and oxygen. 
        When foods are canned they are preserved by killing all the microorganism 
        in the food and the storage container by sterilization, and by keeping 
        the container completely impervious to the entry of additional microorganisms. 
        When foods are preserved by dehydration nearly all of the water is removed. 
        The microorganisms that are in the food are not killed but without water 
        they can not grow and reproduce. When foods are frozen the live microorganisms 
        remain in the food, but the extremely low temperature stops their metabolism 
        so they do not grow and reproduce. (Your refrigerator does not stop the 
        growth of microorganisms, but their metabolism is slowed enough to prevent 
        the food from spoiling before it can be consumed.) Pure honey and molasses 
        are special because they naturally contain ingredients that prevent the 
        growth of microorganisms.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">The best way that I have found to store whole dried foods, 
        like whole wheat berries and dried beans, is to seal them in completely 
        airtight mylar bags made specially for the purpose of long-term food storage</font>. 
        Other plastic bags will work but the mylar bags work the best. First you 
        must start with foods that contain very little moisture, or you must remove 
        the moisture by placing the food in a low temperature oven for complete 
        drying. The oxygen is removed from the bag and the mylar bag is sealed 
        completely airtight with a hot iron. Mylar bags are strong but they are 
        not puncture proof. They must therefore be enclosed in a strong, preferably 
        airtight, container such as a 5 or 6 gallon plastic bucket with an airtight 
        lid, such as the ones that you can purchase at hardware stores.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">There are two good ways for removing the oxygen from 
        the airtight mylar bags.</font> The easiest way is to throw in a couple 
        of oxygen absorbing packets just before you seal the bag. These can usually 
        be purchased from the same supplier who supplied your mylar bags. The 
        other way to remove the oxygen is to use carbon dioxide to replace the 
        oxygen in the bags. </p>
      <p>The easiest way to employ carbon dioxide is to use dry ice, which is 
        frozen carbon dioxide gas. Dry ice can be purchased from the same ice 
        dealers that sell blocks of regular ice. You will find them in your Yellow 
        Pages. Dry ice is extremely cold and must be handled carefully. If it 
        touches your skin it can cause a &quot;burn.&quot; It must therefore be 
        handled with gloves. Fill your storage container to within about a half 
        inch (1 cm) of the top. Put a piece of dry ice on top of the food and 
        put the lid on but do not seal the lid yet. As the gas evaporates (or 
        sublimates) it will cause pressure to build in the container which could 
        rupture it. You have to wait for the dry ice to evaporate completely, 
        turning completely into carbon dioxide gas, and then you seal the container. 
        As it sublimates it will drive the air out of the container. Carbon dioxide 
        is heavier than air and so it will remain in the container if you do not 
        disturb it too much. One to two ounces (50 g) of dry ice is all that is 
        needed for each 5 to 6 gallon (20 l) bucket of food.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">My favorite way to remove the oxygen is by using oxygen 
        absorbing packs.</font> The food most commonly used for long-term storage 
        is whole wheat berries (Winter wheat) so I will use it as an example. 
        Below is how I do it from start to finish:</p>
      <p>I purchase organically grown whole wheat berries (Winter wheat) from 
        a natural foods grocery store that sells in bulk. <b>Whole Foods Market</b> 
        is a national chain that sells bulk foods but there are others including 
        local sources. Rather than buying from the bulk department of the store, 
        I place my order with the store manager and receive my wheat berries in 
        50 lb bags. They give me a discount of about 10% when I order by the bag. 
        I also purchase other grains and beans for long-term storage in this manner.

              a pound for the organically grown berries.) These berries were cheaper 
              because they were bagged for &quot;seed.&quot; (Wheat berries and 
              other whole foods bagged for animal feed are ideal.) They are essentially 
              the same berries except they have not been cleaned quite as well 
              and of course are not organic. We recommend you use organic whenever

      <p>As I mentioned earlier, the 5 or 6 gallon (20 l) plastic buckets that 
        you can buy in hardware stores are a convenient size in which to store 
        your bulk items. These buckets are made out of two different types of 
        plastic, one is food-grade and the other is not. I seal my foods in mylar 
        bags so they don't come in contact with the plastic bucket so it doesn't 
        matter to me whether they are food grade or not. If you store any of your 
        bulk foods in direct contact with the plastic bucket you will want to 
        use food-grade buckets only. Those that have already been used to store 
        foods, like the ones that restaurants use, are perfectly fine, and you 
        may be able to acquire these for little or no money. </p>
      <p>I order my mylar bags from Walton Feed, Inc. online at <a href="http://www.waltonfeed.com/">http://www.waltonfeed.com/</a>. 
        They come in many different sizes but I have found that the 20 in x 30 
        in size is perfect for 5 or 6 gallon buckets. I place the mylar bag in 
        the plastic bucket and fill it with the wheat berries. Then I throw in 
        one 2000 cc oxygen absorbing pack, or two or three of the smaller sized 
        packs, squeeze the excess air out of the bag (or suck it out using a plastic 
        hose) and then seal it with a hot iron. You have to work quickly to avoid 
        overly exposing your oxygen absorbing packs to air, which will decrease 
        their effectiveness. Next I trim off any excess from the top of the mylar 
        bag (optional) and firmly seal the lid on the bucket using a rubber mallet. 
        The wheat berries are now ready for long-term storage in my basement.</p>
      <p>I use the same technique to store other items that I buy in bulk, including 
        pinto beans, corn, oats, etc. Most other items will not have the 100 year 
        or longer shelf-life that the wheat berries have. If you start with whole 
        foods that have a very low moisture content, most foods will have at least 
        a 10 year shelf-life when stored in this way. Obviously you should label 
        each bucket with its contents and the date it was sealed. It would also 
        be a good idea to put a &quot;Use by&quot; date on the bucket, in case 
        you forget what the shelf-life is or in case it is opened by someone else.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\sealingmylarbags2.jpg"><img src="img\sealingmylarbags2.jpg" width="352" height="528" border="0" alt="Sealing mylar bags"></a></p>
      <p>Here's a hint for helping you seal the mylar bags with a hot iron: Take 
        a 30 inch (or 80 cm) 2x4 board and wrap an old towel around it a few times 
        to make an &quot;ironing board.&quot; You can staple or nail the towel 
        on the underside of the board to keep it in place. When you are ready 
        to seal your mylar bag lay this ironing board across the top of the bucket 
        and lay the mylar bag over it to make your job easier (as demonstrated 
        in the photograph above and in the video.) Make sure your seal is complete, 
        and then trim off any excess from the top of the mylar bag. You will have 
        to experiment a little with your iron to determine the ideal temperature. 
        Trim off a small strip from the top of one of your mylar bags and try 
        sealing it with your iron to determine the best setting.</p>
      <p>The list below gives the approximate shelf-life for some common bulk 
        items when stored in this manner. These numbers are conservative. It is 
        quite possible that the foods will keep longer. However, all foods lose 
        some of their nutritional value when stored over an extended period of 
        time. The longer they are stored the more nutrition is lost. You should 
        therefore try to rotate these foods out, replacing them with new stock, 
        according to the shelf lifes suggested below. If you open a container 
        and find that the food is moldy, it will most likely be because it contained 
        too much moisture when you sealed it, or else it was exposed to air due 
        to a faulty seal. Throw it in your compost.</p>
      <p>If you are wheat intolerant then obviously you will want to store other 
        grains. But keep in mind that most other grains will not have the shelf-life 
        of wheat and so you will need to rotate your stock.</p>

      to Survival: Four Foods and More to Use and Store</a>, survivalist writer 
      Esther Dickey recommends whole wheat berries as one of the four foods which 
      should make up &quot;the basic components of an emergency survival diet.&quot; 
      (The others are powdered milk, honey and salt.) Her book is a rich source 
      of recipes for the many and varied ways in which you can use your whole 
      wheat berries, from sprouting (an excellent way to add fresh greens to your 
      diet) to making gluten (a source of protein) to baking whole wheat bread&#151;the 
      staple of life. Unfortunately her excellent book is out of print, but used

      <font size="+1">If you store wheat berries, learn now how to sprout them 
      to make wheat grass! </font>Sprouted wheat berries and wheat grass are much 
      better for you, and are much more easily digested, than the other ways that 
      you will consume your wheat berries, even better than grinding them to make 
      bread. Wheat berries contain gluten, which is a difficult protein to digest. 
      Many individuals develop an intolerance to gluten and must avoid it entirely. 
      Often, the more wheat you eat, the more intolerant your body grows to it. 
      So even if you don't have a lot of trouble eating products that contain 
      gluten now, you can develop the problem in the future, especially if wheat 
      ever becomes a major food source, like after a collapse when you break out 
      your wheat storage. Caution should be used when considering wheat berries 
      and wheat products, because many people have sub-clinical (below the surface) 
      problems with wheat, including hidden wheat allergies. But with a storage 
      life of practically forever (when stored properly), wheat berries are of 
      course an excellent food to put up for long-term emergency storage. Sprouting 
      your wheat berries will go a long way in adding additional nutrition and 
      variety to your wheat berries, and will help prevent wheat or gluten intolerances 
      that will surely occur if people are ever forced to rely on stored wheat 
      as a primary source of food. </td>

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_D">Nutritional Supplements</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">Do you take a multivitamin?</font> There are so many 
        nutritional supplements on the market today that trying to decide which 
        ones you need can be confusing. While there are many supplements that 
        may be helpful for individual needs, there is one that I consider essential 
        for everyone. If you take nothing else you should take a good high-quality 
        multivitamin/multimineral supplement on a daily basis. Most vitamins are 
        fat-soluble and can be stored by your body. (The exceptions are Vitamin 
        C and B-complex, which are water soluble.) Trace minerals, which are grossly 
        lacking in the typical American diet, are also very important for maintaining 
        your health, and like fat-soluble vitamins they too can be stored by the 
        body. How much better could your body survive hard times if it is well 
        stocked with these important nutrients when the emergency occurs, as opposed 
        to beginning such a stressful situation with an already deficient supply? 
        When we are under stress, our bodies use up our nutrient stores faster, 
        and therefore we may need even more than usual. An adequate supply of 
        these important nutrients will allow you to endure stress more easily, 
        increasing your resistance to mental and physical disease. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">As I have already mentioned, the longer foods are stored 
        the more nutritional value they lose</font>. And we all understand that 
        one of the keys to sound nutrition is a highly varied diet. But during 
        times of emergency we will no doubt be restricted in the variety of foods 
        that we have available to us. In fact, we might be eating a lot of the 
        same foods over and over. These factors, along with the fact that our 
        bodies need more vitamins and minerals when under stress, mean that it 
        will be even more important to take a multivitamin/multimineral supplement 
        during times of emergency than during normal times. So I consider a good 
        supplement to be an essential part of any emergency food stash.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Vitamins have a shelf-life of at least two years.</font> 
        Minerals are literally rocks that will keep forever. After the recommended 
        two-year shelf-life has been exceeded, the vitamins will still be viable. 
        It's just that they will have lost some of their potency. The older they 
        are the more potency they will lose. You do not have to discard your vitamins 
        after the expiration date. You can continue taking them. They may not 
        be as potent as when you purchased them but they will be better than nothing.</p>

        Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals</a> in my emergency food stash. Everyone 
        in my family takes this supplement so we do not have a problem keeping 
        our stock fresh. We just have to remember that when we empty a bottle 
        and purchase a new one it has to go to the back of the shelf, and every 
        other bottle has to be moved forward. When we take a bottle off the shelf 
        we are careful to grab the oldest one, which will be the one in the front. 
        That way all of our vitamins always remain as fresh as possible. Super 
        Supplemental contains some calcium, but since we try to take a higher 
        amount of this important mineral, along with additional magnesium, a mineral 
        that is heavily lost in food processing, we store a year's supply of <a target="blank" href="http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/products/product/stocknumber3194">Calcium-Magnesium</a> 
        as well. You may choose to store additional supplements (and essential 
        medicines as well.) Just remember to store what you use and to use what 
        you store&#151;and above all, don't forget to rotate your stock!</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Every organic gardener knows the benefits of composting.</font> 
        Composting allows you to recycle vegetable matter from your kitchen, as 
        well as your yard and garden wastes, to convert it, with the help of beneficial 
        bacteria and industrious earthworms, into an excellent material that you 
        can work into your garden soil to aerate and fertilize it. Composting 
        can be done anywhere, even in the city where space is limited. You can 
        even keep a small earthworm compost bin just for kitchen scraps in your 
        basement or garage. I do not add meat scraps or dairy products to my compost, 
        preferring to keep the material of vegetable origin only, in order to 
        eliminate odors and flies. The exception is egg shells which can be added 
        to compost without creating any problems. The calcium in egg shells is 
        also great for your soil. Even if you do not have a garden you should 
        compost your vegetable trash and yard waste to produce less strain on 
        our overflowing land fills and garbage dumps, and to be less reliant on 
        city services, which may be interrupted during a prolonged emergency. 
        (We will discuss waste disposal in a later chapter of this web site.)</p>

      <p>The two compost bins that I keep behind my garage are shown in the photograph 
        above. This type is normally too expensive in my opinion, but I was fortunate 
        enough to acquire these two at estate sales for only a few dollars each. 
        You can easily make your own compost bins by forming hardware cloth or 
        chicken wire into a cylinder, leaving it open at both the top and the 
        bottom. (Note the two rain barrels also in this photograph.)</p>

      <p>It would be hard to find an ornamental tree that could exceed the beauty 
        of a dwarf apricot tree. My apricot tree produces a bounty of fruit each 
        year&#151;far more than my family can consume, even though we preserve 
        much of our fruit by canning and dehydration. Apricot trees are among 
        my favorites not only because of their delicious fruit, but also because 
        they produce beautiful and fragrant flowers in the early Spring. The photograph 
        above shows a honey bee pollinating the blossoms of my apricot tree. A 
        bee hive will provide plenty of delicious honey&#151;a natural sweetener 
        and healthful sugar alternative&#151;and as an added bonus the industrious 
        little workers will insure that all the blooms of your fruits and vegetables 
        are pollinated, which will maximize production. </p>

      <p>This beautiful dwarf Asian pear tree in my front yard (above) also produces 
        a bounty of delicious and healthful fruit. Growing many different types 
        of fruit not only provides variety, but the work of harvesting and preserving 
        is spread out since each ripens at a different time.</p>

      <p>Even though my property is in a suburb of a major city, and is only average 
        in size, I also manage to grow a peach tree, two apple trees, two cherry 
        trees, another pear tree and a paw paw tree in my back yard. This is in 
        addition to a long row of 10 blackberry vines, another of 10 grape vines, 
        and a nice-sized vegetable garden. </p>
      <p>It is amazing how much of your own food you can grow, even on a small 
        property. If you live on a larger lot you can of course grow much more, 
        maybe even corn, wheat and other grains. Nut trees are also excellent 
        if you have the space and are willing to fight the squirrels for your 
        nuts.</p>

      <p>It is not the purpose of this web site to give details on how to grow 
        fruits and vegetables. There are many good books available, including 
        the ones in the <a title="Additional Resources" href="survival_resources.html">Additional 
        Resources</a> section at the end of this web site and under &quot;Recommended 
        Reading&quot; at the bottom of this page. I suggest that you acquire a 
        few good books and start learning now. If you are new to gardening you 
        may find that some of your efforts will not pan out at first. But through 
        time, with experience and learning, you will build your skills and develop 
        your repertoire of favorite plants. You will get better with each season 
        and when the emergency occurs you will be ready.</p>
      <p> 
      <h4 align="left">Save Your Seeds</h4>
      <p>Store-bought seeds will remain viable for at least 2 to 3 years, although 
        their germination rate will decrease through time. Store your extra store-bought 
        seeds by keeping them cool and dry in airtight containers such as mason 
        jars or plastic bags. Refrigerating or freezing your seeds is not recommended. 
        You should also save your own seeds from your garden. Just be sure to 
        dry them thoroughly in the sun before storing them.</p>

      <h4>Dealing with Thieves</h4>
      <p>Even during normal times I find that there are sometimes people who will 
        help themselves to the bounty of my labor, particularly to my fruit. Imagine 
        how much more of a problem thievery will become when there is a shortage 
        of food during a prolonged emergency. You might want to give some thought 
        now to camouflaging or hiding at least part of your garden. I have seen 
        people hide their gardens by growing edible plants in flower beds close 
        to their house. There are so few people these days who know how to live 
        off the land that most people don't even recognize a common edible plant 
        when they see one (although everyone knows what a fruit looks like.) Some 
        foods, like parsnips, potatoes and carrots, grow underground and are even 
        less obvious to the uninitiated. Sunchokes are also easy to hide. The 
        edible part grows underground and most people have no idea what they are.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">To help meet your protein needs you might also want to 
        keep some type of livestock.</font> There are many animals to consider, 
        depending on space and local zoning laws. Goats will provide milk as well 
        as meat. Chickens will provide eggs and meat. For city dwellers the most 
        practical animals to keep are pigeons and rabbits. Pigeons are too messy 
        for me so I greatly prefer rabbits. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Rabbit meat is delicious and healthy. Rabbits are extremely 
        prolific and will eat just about any plant materials.</font> Don't throw 
        your corn husks into the compost! They are a favorite food for rabbits! 
        Rabbits do not take up much space. They are quiet and easy to hide from 
        your neighbors. We have a small one-car garage where we keep six rabbit 
        hutches along with my garden tiller, lawn mower, a stash of twelve 20 
        lb propane tanks and a few bails of hay&#151;And we still have room for 
        our car as well!</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\FloridaWhite.jpg"><img src="img\FloridaWhite.jpg" width="512" height="342" border="0" alt="Florida White rabbit"></a></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Florida Whites are the best breed to keep for survival 
        food when there are space limitations to consider.</font> It is a compact 
        breed that has been developed especially for meat production. They are 
        a medium-sized breed, but they produce the greatest amount of meat per 
        pound of feed consumed. And the meat is excellent! They also require much 
        smaller hutches than the larger breeds and so they take up less space. 
        They are perfect for city survivors.</p>

      <p>I built these six hutches (above), each measuring 2x2x3 feet, for my 
        Florida Whites using the instructions found in my favorite rabbit book, 
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603424571?ie=UTF8&tag=natuhealsch01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1603424571">Storey's

        by Bob Bennett. To get the most from my limited space the hutches are 
        hung from the joists in the ceiling of my garage. Worm bins underneath 
        the rabbit hutches help keep odors and flies to a minimum. Worms love 
        rabbit manure and are happy to speed up the decomposition process producing 
        rich soil for the garden.</p>
      <p>Rabbit manure is the best fertilizer available for your garden and is 
        highly prized by growers everywhere. It can go directly from beneath your 
        rabbit hutches to your garden without any danger of burning your plants. 
        Even if I didn't eat meat I think I would keep rabbits just for this &quot;black 
        gold&quot; for my garden.</p>

      <p>These Florida Whites are &quot;sharing&quot; a plantain leaf. The best 
        food for your rabbits is the pellets that you purchase at hardware and 
        feed stores. These should form the bulk of their diets, but you can supplement 
        with hay, &quot;weeds&quot; (that have not been sprayed with herbicides), 
        and vegetable waste from your kitchen. Rabbits enjoy the parts of the 
        vegetables that you would normally throw in the compost, including corn 
        husks, carrot tops, cores, skins, etc. They absolutely love blackberry 
        leaves, grape leaves, plantains and dandelions. Comfrey is an excellent 
        food and a medicine as well and is easy to grow in your garden. Blackberry 
        leaves are also good medicine for your rabbits, particularly good for 
        diarrhea (which is probably due to overfeeding your rabbits&#151;the most 
        common mistake that rabbit owners make.) It is a good idea to keep a few 
        bails of hay (not straw) on hand for supplemental food, nesting material, 
        and for emergency food for your emergency food.</p>
