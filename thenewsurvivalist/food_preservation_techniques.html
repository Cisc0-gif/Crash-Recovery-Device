        and have a huge barbecue for your entire neighborhood. But you would rather 
        preserve some of this meat to feed your family during the coming months. 
        Well, you can cut the meat into thin strips and dry it or smoke it making 
        jerky. Or if you have a pressure canner and a heat source you can pressure 
        can it. But first you will have to dress it!</p>

      <p><font size="+1">An animal must be field dressed or &quot;gutted&quot; 
        immediately after it is killed&#151;on the spot!</font> Otherwise the 
        meat will go bad very quickly. Even in very cold weather the inside of 
        a large animal will stay warm for a long time after it dies. That heavy 
        coat of fur that keeps the animal warm through the winter also keeps its 
        insides warm for a long time after it has been killed. The digestive systems 
        of all animals contain billions of microorganisms that do no harm when 
        the animals are alive. But when the blood ceases to circulate and the 
        immune system ceases to function, those microorganisms will cause the 
        animal to deteriorate very rapidly. To protect the meat the &quot;guts&quot; 
        have to be removed immediately&#151;in the field&#151;a process known 
        as field dressing. The process is essentially the same for all animals. 
        As an example I will briefly describe the basics of field dressing a deer. 
        There are good videos available at hunting and outdoor stores that describe 
        the process in detail, and a picture is worth a thousand words, as they 
        say, so if you don't already know how to field dress an animal I would 
        recommend that you acquire such a video and learn how to do it now. One 
        that I recommend in DVD format is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LASF0?ie=UTF8&tag=natuhealsch01-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0001LASF0">Practical 
        Game Processing and Deer Butchering</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=natuhealsch01-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0001LASF0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"> 
        by Timothy Flynn and Gary Zick. Don't wait until you have a fresh kill 
        on your hands. You will have to act quickly, which means that you will 
        need to know what to do in advance.</p>
      <p>If the animal is a buck, first cut off the genitals with a sharp knife. 
        Then slit the underbelly of the animal from the genitals to the ribcage, 
        being careful not to cut the intestines. After your initial incision slip 
        two fingers under the skin to hold the skin up slightly away from the 
        intestines to keep from nipping them. Pull all of the organs out of the 
        body cavity, using your knife to cut away anything that is attached. Save 
        the liver. The kidneys will be located in the flank of the animal. These 
        should be cut away and also saved. Under the rib cage is a muscular diaphragm 
        separating the abdominal cavity (which you just emptied) from the chest 
        cavity. Cut around this diaphragm to remove the chest organs, which consists 
        mostly of the heart and lungs. Reach up inside the chest cavity as high 
        into the throat as possible with your knife, and cut the windpipe and 
        then pull all the organs of the chest out of the animal in one mass. Save 
        the heart. Rinse out the inside of the animal with cold water being particularly 
        careful to wash out any intestinal contents that may have leaked into 
        the carcass, which is now ready for transporting. </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\deerhunters.jpg"><img src="img\deerhunters.jpg" width="512" height="454" border="0" alt="Deer hunters"></a></p>
      <p>Next, make slits behind the Achilles tendons of both rear legs so that 
        you can hang the animal upside down (as seen in the photograph above.) 
        You can hasten the cooling down of the interior of the animal by propping 
        open the internal cavity with a stick so that cold air can get to the 
        inside. The animal may now be skinned and butchered. </p>
      <p>During normal times my preferred method for keeping meat is in my freezer. 
        For our purposes, however, I will assume that electricity is not readily 
        available so I will describe two methods of preserving meat which require 
        no refrigeration.</p>

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_21">Smoking Meat &amp; Making 
        Jerky</h3>
      <p><font size="+1">Before refrigeration people relied on salt and smoke 
        to preserve their meat.</font> Most people lived on family farms and the 
        &quot;smoke house&quot; was as familiar as the outhouse. Refrigeration 
        changed the way we did a lot of things, but one thing it did not change 
        was our taste for the flavor of smoked meat. Consequently, smokers are 
        readily available today and recipes abound, including those for smoking 
        your meat in your backyard grill. But one thing that nearly all of these 
        recipes have in common is: the meat is cooked and so the end product will 
        require refrigeration. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">To preserve meat that will not require refrigeration 
        a process known as <b>Hard Smoking</b> is required.</font> Hard smoked 
        meat is similar to jerky. It contains a lot of salt, and it is smoked 
        at a low temperature until there is very little moisture left in it. It 
        is kind of like the dehydration method used for fruits and vegetables, 
        but done with smoke and the addition of salt and usually other spices 
        as well. The salt helps preserve the meat by inhibiting the growth of 
        microorganisms. Sometimes the meat is so salty that you may even want 
        to soak it for a few hours before eating it to remove some of the salt. 
        (People used to save this water and reclaim the salt by allowing the water 
        to evaporate.)</p>
      <p>The smoked meats and jerky that you buy in stores today contain preservatives 
        called nitrites, so their moisture content may be slightly higher and 
        their salt content slightly lower. Their recommended shelf-life is one 
        year. Nitrites are known to cause cancer so their consumption should be 
        limited. The jerky that you make at home, if preserved properly, should 
        keep indefinitely even without nitrites, but as with any preserved food 
        its quality will deteriorate over time. It would best be best to consume 
        it within six months to a year.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Spices have been highly prized over the centuries, with 
        certain spices at times being worth more than their weight in gold.</font> 
        You might recall, from your American history class, that when Christopher 
        Columbus discovered the New World he was actually looking for a shorter 
        trade with India, primarily for spices. We enjoy spices because they impart 
        interesting flavors to our foods. But before the days of refrigeration 
        they were also highly valued for their ability to preserve food. By using 
        certain spices that have strong antimicrobial actions, we can reduce the 
        amount of salt needed to preserve our meat, making it more palatable and 
        healthier at the same time.</p>
      <p>Spices with antimicrobial action include garlic, ginger, black pepper, 
        clove, oregano, thyme, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, bay leaves, mustard, 
        rosemary, bishop's weed, chilli (also called cayenne or red pepper), horseradish, 
        cumin, black cumin, pomegranate seeds, onion, celery, geranium and many 
        others. Some spices by themselves have weak antimicrobial effects that 
        become much stronger when combined with other spices. (These combinations 
        are said to be <b>synergistic</b>, because the combination is greater 
        than the sum of the individual parts.) Chili powder is a synergistic combination 
        typically consisting of red pepper (cayenne), onion, paprika, garlic, 
        cumin and oregano. Five-spice powder is a synergistic combination of pepper, 
        cinnamon, anise, fennel and cloves. Most people think that the combination 
        of spices known as curry powder originated in India. But curry is actually 
        a Western blend devised during colonial times combining the best spices 
        from India. Curry powder recipes vary slightly, but turmeric is always 
        a key ingredient in the blend. The usual recipe for curry powder in the 
        West consists of turmeric, cardamom, cumin, fenugreek and chilles. Other 
        herbs that are commonly included in curry blends include ginger, garlic,

      <h4 align="left">Safety Precautions</h4>
      <p><font size="+1">Jerky is considered a very safe and effective method 
        of preserving meat. </font>However, over the years a few incidents of 
        food poisoning have been reported as a result of improperly cured jerky. 
        This can be easily avoided if a few commonsense precautions are followed:</p>
      <p>1) Cleanliness is rule number one. It begins in the field when the animal 
        is field dressed or gutted. Try to keep the meat from coming into contact 
        with the contents of the intestines. Rinse the inside of the animal thoroughly 
        with water if possible. </p>
      <p>2) Before preparing any food wash your hands thoroughly using soap and 
        water. Use a mild chlorine bleach solution (one tablespoon of bleach to 
        a gallon of water) to clean all surfaces and materials that will come 
        into contact with the meat. (By now it should be evident that chlorine 
        bleach is an important survival item that should be stored in sufficient 
        quantities.)</p>
      <p>3) The use an oven thermometer to insure that your smoker/dryer maintains 
        the proper temperature is recommended. </p>
      <p>4) Jerky must be completely dry, since bacteria require moisture to grow. 
        Properly dried jerky should crack when bent in half, but not necessarily 
        break into two pieces. Allow the jerky to cool to room temperature before 
        testing.</p>
      <p>5) Avoid Cross-Contamination by not allowing your finished product to 
        come into contact with surfaces that have been contaminated by raw meat</p>
      <p>6) Store jerky in airtight jars or plastic bags to prevent it from absorbing 
        moisture and bacteria from the air. Allow the jerky to cool to room temperature 
        before placing it into airtight containers.</p>
      <p>7) If moisture appears on the inside of the storage container the jerky 
        is not dry enough. Dry it longer.</p>

      <h4 align="left">Drying/Smoking Temperatures</h4>
      <p> There are a lot of opinions regarding ideal drying/smoking temperatures. 
        Some differences of opinion are the result of safety concerns, and some 
        have to do with what you intend to do with the meat. Those who plan on 
        storing their dried meats in a refrigerator or freezer tend to cook their 
        meat as well as dry it. It is important to remember that cooked meat is 
        not suitable for long term storage and must be stored in a refrigerator 
        or freezer or else eaten within a few days. When properly cured and dried, 
        without cooking, meat will keep indefinitely, (although its quality will 
        begin to deteriorate after a few months so it should probably be eaten 
        within a year.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Because of the natural preservative nature of smoke, smoking meat can 
        be safely done at a lower temperature than that used when drying meat 
        without smoke. Also, meat properly cured with salt and spices can be safely 
        dried or smoked at a lower temperature. In general, I believe that it 
        is best to use the lower temperatures, by using the smoking process rather 
        than drying alone, and being sure to cure the meat with salt and spices 
        beforehand.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The USDA recommends drying/smoking temperatures of 145<sup>o</sup> F 
        for 7 hours or 155<sup>o</sup> for 4 hours. Care should be taken not to 
        exceed 155<sup>o</sup> F or the meat will get cooked rather than dried. 
        Lower drying temperatures of 125<sup>o</sup> F for 10 hours or 135<sup>o</sup> 
        F for 8 hours are recommended by some, and I have even seen recommendations 
        as low as 95<sup>o</sup> to 130<sup>o</sup> F. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>I recommend that you begin the drying process at a lower temperature, 
        say around 125<sup>o</sup> F, and then gradually increase it each hour 
        until the maximum temperature of 145<sup>o</sup> to 150<sup>o</sup> F 
        is reached for the final hour or so. This will insure that the meat is 
        thoroughly dried through and through without getting cooked. Check the 
        meat for doneness by allowing a piece to cool down and then bend it.</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>To convert degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius subtract 32, then multiply by 
        five and divide by 9. Or use the following approximations:</p>

      <h4 align="left">The Drying/Smoking Process<br>
      </h4>
      <p><font size="+1">Smoking the meat is not an absolute necessity, but in 
        my opinion it is highly desirable&#151;not only because the smoke imparts 
        a nice flavor to the meat, but more importantly because the smoke is a 
        natural preservative.</font> Jerky can be made in an ordinary oven by 
        leaving the oven door open slightly to allow the moisture to escape. It 
        is important that the temperature does not exceed 155<sup>o</sup> F because 
        you want to dry the meat rather than cook it. Cooked meat is not preserved. 
        You should set an oven thermometer on the oven rack toward the back to 
        monitor the heat. Obviously this is best done in the cold months of the 
        year when the heat escaping from the oven can be used to help keep your 
        house warm, rather than increasing your air conditioning bill.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Drying jerky can also be done in a food dehydrator. Again a thermometer 
        may be advisable to monitor the heat. Even if your dehydrator has a temperature 
        setting, these are often inaccurate. A solar dehydrator is also an option. 
        The Native Americans (who taught the European settlers about jerky in 
        the first place) used to dry their meat in the open air and sun. In some 
        cultures the meat is actually hung in the sun on the thorns of shrubs. 
        <b>So, despite all of these seemingly complicated instructions, never 
        forget that making jerky is not rocket science!</b></p>
      <p> As I have mentioned my favorite way to make jerky is in a smoker, using 
        the natural preservative nature of the smoke to help preserve the meat. 
        Ordinarily smokers contain a pan of water, which helps keep the meat moist. 
        However, the end product of most smoking recipes will require refrigeration. 
        Our intention is to use the hard smoking process to make jerky, with a 
        very low moisture content, that will keep indefinitely without refrigeration. 
        So skip the water! I also recommended that you monitor the temperature, 
        keeping it below 155<sup>o</sup> F, so that your meat will be dried rather 
        than cooked. Many commercial smokers are available, using gas, charcoal 
        or wood. They can also be easily made using inexpensive materials.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\smoker.jpg"><img src="img\smoker.jpg" width="352" height="528" border="0" alt="Smoker"></a></p>
      <p>The recipes and directions that come with most smokers, like the one 
        pictured above, will result in the meat being cooked rather than hard 
        smoked. The end product will require refrigeration. Our intention is to 
        make jerky that will not require refrigeration, so we want to use the 
        hard smoking process which is accomplished by using smoke at a lower temperature.</p>
      <p>I have seen a very effective homemade smoker made by a deer hunter. He 
        used his smoker to process his entire deer into jerky in a matter of a 
        couple of days. It consisted of a large wooden box with screened shelves 
        that would slide out. (If you make your own smoker or dryer don't use 
        metal screens. They are galvanized with zinc which is not suitable for 
        contact with food.) He would dig a fire pit about 6 feet from the smoker. 
        On top of the pit he put a 6 foot length of 6 inch galvanized vent pipe 
        (the kind you use to vent your furnace) on a slight incline leading from 
        the fire pit to a hole in the lower side of the smoke box. He would start 
        a fire in the fire pit and then cover it with a piece of sheet metal to 
        keep the fire smoldering and to direct the smoke through the vent pipe 
        and into the smoke box. </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\smoker4.jpg"><img src="img\smoker4.jpg" width="352" height="528" border="0" alt="Smoker setup"></a></p>
      <p>Another ingenious method suitable for the cold months of the year makes 
        use of a wood burning stove in your house, with the stove pipe running 
        to the outside of your house and into your smoker. Since smoke rises, 
        the smoker must be at a higher level than your stove. Sufficient stove 
        pipe should be used to insure that the smoke cools enough before entering 
        the smoker, otherwise the meat could get cooked rather than dried. A heat 
        reclaimer on the stove pipe inside the house can also increase the efficiency 
        of such a unit, further reclaiming the heat for the house and cooling 
        down the smoke sufficiently for the smoker at the same time. This is the 
        procedure that I use (illustrated in the photograph above) using a wood 
        stove in my basement with the stove pipe running through a basement window 
        and into my smoker on the outside. Needless to say great care should be 
        taken to avoid setting your house on fire. Never leave such a unit unattended!<br>
      </p>
      <p>There is a variety of opinions regarding the best wood to burn in your 
        smoker. I don't think it matters a lot, so use what you have available. 
        Any hardwoods will do. Fruit trees like apple will do very nicely. When 
        I prune my fruit trees I save the trimmings to use for my smoker. I have 
        never used pine but I have heard others say that it should be avoided.</p>

      <h4 align="left">Making Jerky</h4>
      <p>Select the leanest cuts of meat for making jerky and remove all visible 
        fat. Fat does not preserve well and can adversely affect the taste and 
        quality of your jerky. For a product that does not require refrigeration 
        you are going to want to remove as much moisture from the meat as possible. 
        This can be accomplished more easily by slicing the meat very thin. Slice 
        the meat across the grain (at a right angle to long muscles) for the most 
        tender jerky, or with the grain for a more chewy jerky. Cut it into strips 
        no more than a quarter of an inch (6 mm) thick. This is more easily accomplished 
        if the meat is slightly frozen. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Basic Brine recipe:</b> Two cups of salt, 1 cup of sugar, 1 tsp. ground 
        black pepper, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/2 
        tsp. of turmeric powder. Other herbs and spices may be used according 
        to availability and tastes. The only ingredient that is absolutely essential 
        is the salt. To make a liquid for cold marinating or for a boiling marinade 
        add this dry mixture to 2 quarts of water. The mixture can be made slightly 
        weaker (more water) for a boiling marinade. For a dry marinade mix the 
        dry ingredients without any liquids.<br>
      </p>
      <p> 
      <h4 align="left">Cold Marinade<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Soak the strips of meat in the marinade in a refrigerator overnight, 
        or for at least three hours. This is most easily done in a plastic bag. 
        At least once during the marinating process shake the bag and turn it 
        over to insure that all the meat comes into contact with the marinade. 
        After the meat has been marinated, remove it from the marinade, shake 
        off the excess and put it in the dryer or smoker. Some people are concerned 
        about bacterial growth in the cold marinade. Certainly this step should 
        be done in the refrigerator. If refrigeration is not available, alternative 
        methods include boiling marinade and dry marinade.<br>
      </p>
      <p> 
      <h4 align="left">Boiling Marinade<br>
      </h4>
      <p>As an extra precaution, the USDA recommends that meat be precooked to 
        at least 160<sup>o</sup> F before drying. This is accomplished by skipping 
        the cold marinade, and instead, the raw meat is dipped into a boiling 
        marinade until the it turns gray (one to two minutes.) Then it is dried 
        or smoked as usual. Care should be taken not to cook the meat too much. 
        No other marinating is necessary because the heat causes the marinade 
        to penetrate the meat very rapidly. I don't think that such a precooking 
        step is necessary, but a boiling marinade may be a desirable alternative 
        if your refrigerator is not working. I prefer the following dry marinating 
        process instead.<br>
      </p>
      <p> 
      <h4 align="left">Dry marinade<br>
      </h4>
      <p>During a prolonged emergency the dry marinating process may be the best 
        choice, not only because it requires less energy, but also because it 
        makes the most economical use of your marinade. The dry marinade is mixed 
        well and sprinkled generously onto a large cutting board. The strips of 
        meat are laid on the dry marinade, first one side and then the other, 
        to coat both sides well. Then a wooden mallet is used to pound the marinade 
        into the meat. If your refrigerator is working, or if it is very cold 
        outdoors, the strips can be stacked one upon the other, put in a plastic 
        bag or closed container, and put in the cold for a few hours or overnight 
        to allow the dry marinade to soak into the meat. This step is not necessary, 
        since you have pounded the marinade into the meat with the wooden hammer, 
        so if the temperature is warm it may be best to immediately shake off 
        the excess marinade and put the strips in the smoker or dryer.</p>

        preserve meat.</font> Unlike tomatoes and fruits, which may be canned 
        in a boiling water bath, meats must be canned at the higher temperatures 
        that are only achievable by a pressure canner. Any pressure cooker can 
        be used for pressure canning, but many pressure cookers are too small 
        to be of much use in canning. A pressure canner is simply a pressure cooker 
        that is large enough to hold a practical number of mason jars. It is certainly 
        a good investment if you are interested in pressure canning. Instructions 
        for pressure canning can be found with any good pressure canner and in 
        many cookbooks as well. I will discuss pressure canning in further detail 
        in a later section of this chapter.</p>

      The photograph above shows a pressure cooker (on the left) and a pressure 
      canner. Either may be used for pressure canning, although the canner is 
      obviously more practical because it will hold more jars. A pressure cooker 
      is an essential appliance in our home because it allows us to cook foods 
      like whole brown rice in about a third of the time normally required. </td>

        air rises passing around and through the foods, which are placed on screens 
        to allow maximum circulation. To insure adequate dehydration the foods 
        are generally prepared for the drying process by slicing them very thin. 
        The warm air picks up moisture from the food and carries it out the top 
        of the unit, while cooler and dryer air flows in from the bottom. For 
        best results the temperature should be raised very gradually over a period 
        of hours. Otherwise the outside of the food could become dry, locking 
        the moisture in the inside and preventing the food from drying completely. 
        Inexpensive food dehydration units for home use are readily available 
        and are very effective. Solar energy also works very well as a heat source 
        for dehydrating foods, and many foods are dried simply by placing them 
        out in the open air in a sunny location (preferably with some protection 
        against insects.)</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Dehydrated foods do not require refrigeration.</font> 
        Without moisture the microorganisms that are responsible for food spoilage 
        can not grow. Care must be taken to insure that most of the water is removed 
        or spoilage, usually from mold, could become a problem. Dehydrated foods 
        will keep for a year or longer when stored in airtight containers or plastic 
        bags. The dryer the food the longer it will store. As with all preservation 
        techniques some nutritional value is lost during the drying process, but 
        dehydration remains one of the best ways to prepare food for storage without 
        refrigeration or sterilization. Dried foods are light and compact making 
        them ideal for backpacking and food storage. You can restore dehydrated 
        foods by soaking them in water for a few hours before using them, but 
        most dehydrated fruits are eaten as-is. You will probably want to reconstitute 
        your dehydrated vegetables before eating them. Dehydrated vegetables are 
        great for soups and stews.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\applepealer3.jpg"><img src="img\applepealer3.jpg" width="512" height="342" border="0" alt="Apple pealer"></a></p>
      <p> It is not necessary to peal fruits before dehydrating them, but pealed 
        fruits will dry faster. This handy countertop apple peeler also cores 
        the apples and slices them into very then and uniform slices ideal for 
        dehydration. You can also use it to slice and core your apples without 
        pealing them. Thin and uniform slices will dry quicker and more efficiently.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\dehydrator.jpg"><img src="img\dehydrator.jpg" width="512" height="341" border="0" alt="Dehydrator with apple slices"></a></p>
      <p>The thinly sliced fruits or vegetables are placed on the screens in single 
        layers, with no overlap, which allows for maximum air circulation. The 
        temperature is set at the lowest setting at first and then gradually increased 
        over the next few hours to prevent the outside of the fruit from drying 
        first, locking moisture on the inside. The fruit or vegetable must be 
        dried all the way through for proper preservation and storage preparation.</p>
      <p>The dried fruits and vegetables are cooled to room temperature and then 
        place in airtight containers such as plastic bags or glass jars. Glass 
        jars could break in an earthquake so plastic storage containers may be 
        preferable.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Canning requires the complete sterilization of the food 
        and container.</font> The naturally occurring enzymes that would cause 
        deterioration of the food in time are also destroyed by the heat used 
        in the canning process. Special glass jars (e.g., Mason jars) and two-piece 
        lids are used for home canning. The lids completely seal the jars with 
        a vacuum inside which keeps all microorganisms out. Properly canned foods 
        will keep almost indefinitely, but their quality begins to deteriorate 
        after about a year so it is recommended that they are consumed within 
        a year or so. </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\pressurecanner.jpg"><img src="img\pressurecanner.jpg" width="523" height="342" border="0" alt="Canners"></a></p>
      <p>Canning in a 10 minute boiling water bath is adequate for high-acid foods 
        such as fruits, tomatoes and foods pickled in vinegar. Nonacid foods such 
        as meat, fish, fowl and vegetables require a higher temperature which 
        is obtainable only in a pressure canner. (The photograph above shows a 
        boiling water bath canner on the left and a pressure canner on the right.)</p>
      <p>Complete instructions for home canning will be found in the instructions 
        that will come with your canning equipment or in any good canning recipe 
        book. Some good canning books are listed in the <a title="Additional Resources" href="survival_resources.html">Additional 
        Resources</a> section at the end of this web site and under &quot;Recommended 
        Reading&quot; at the bottom of this page. The first step for canning fruits 
        or tomatoes in a boiling water bath involves sterilizing the glass jars 
        by boiling them in water for 10 minutes in a large pot. The lids are placed 
        in a separate pan of water which is brought to a simmer (180<sup>o</sup> 
        F) but not boiled. At the same time that the jars are being sterilized, 
        the food is also sterilized by boiling it for 10 minutes in another pot. 
        The hot food is then added to the hot jars and the lids are placed on 
        the jars with the bands screwed on finger tight. The final processing 
        involves boiling the jars of food for another 10 minutes completely submerged 
        in the boiling water bath. If you live more than 1,000 feet above sea 
        level you must increase the boiling time using the following formula: 
        At 1-3,000 feet add 5 min.; 3-6,000 add 10 min.; 6-8,000 add 15 min.; 
        8-10,000 add 20 min. </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\cannedjelly.jpg"><img src="img\cannedjelly.jpg" width="512" height="342" border="0" alt="Canning jelly"></a></p>
      <p>After the boiling water bath the jars are removed and allowed to cool 
        down. During the cooling process the lids should seal, which is indicated 
        by an indentation in the center of the lid. Jars that are sealed are now 
        ready for labeling and storage. Any jars that did not seal can be placed 
        in the refrigerator for immediate consumption or boiled again in the boiling 
        water bath. For jars that don't seal the problem will usually turn out 
        to be food between the rim of the jar and the lid, so the rim should be 
        checked and wiped clean before the second attempt.</p>
      <p>Some recipes call for additional ingredients. Most jellies, for example, 
        will require pectin and sometimes lemon juice for acidity as well. You 
        will probably also want to add sugar to most fruits. Pectin usually comes 
        with good recipes for making jellies and jams.</p>

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_26">Pressure Canning</h3>
      <p>All meats, including fish and fowl, and foods that contain meat, such 
        as stews, must be processed at 240<sup>o</sup> F (115<sup>o</sup> C), 
        which is obtainable only with steam under 10 pounds of pressure (psi.) 
        This pressure must be increased if you live more than 1,000 feet above 
        sea level: At 1-2,000 feet use 11 psi; 2-4,000 use 12; 4-6,000 use 13; 
        6-8,000 use 14; 8-10,000 use 15. If your pressure canner uses a fixed 
        weight that is only adjustable in 5 psi increments use 15 psi if you live 
        over 1,000 feet above sea level. It is not necessary to pre-sterilize 
        jars and lids when the processing time will exceed 10 minutes. Meat should 
        be cut into convenient sized chunks and precooked without flour until 
        the red color changes to brown. The jars are then packed with the meat 
        and filled will boiling broth leaving a one inch head space to allow for 
        expansion. </p>
      <p>Vegetables, due to their low acid content, will also require pressure 
        canning but most only require a half inch head space in the jar. Starchy 
        vegetables such as corn, peas and beans will require a one inch head space 
        for expansion. (Tomatoes, which are technically not a vegetable, may be 
        canned in a boiling water bath as described above for fruits.) </p>
      <p>After packing the jars with food the lids are placed on and the bands 
        are screwed on until resistance is felt. The jars are then placed on the 
        rack in the pressure canner in about two quarts (2 l) of hot water. The 
        cover is place on the pressure canner and the heat is turned on high. 
        The pressure regulator weight is left off or the petcock valve is left 
        wide open to allow air to escape from the canner as the water comes to 
        a boil. When the water starts to boil steam will begin escaping from the 
        canner. Allow steam to escape for 10 minutes to eliminate all air pockets 
        and then completely close the petcock valve or place the regulator weight 
        on the canner. It will take about 5 more minutes for the canner to reached 
        full pressure. After it becomes fully pressurized turn the heat down and 
        begin timing. Usually the lowest setting is adequate to maintain the pressure. 
        When canning meat, pint jars should be processed for 75 minutes and quart 
        jars for 90. Dried beans should be soaked and cooked first and then processed 
        for the same amount of time. Greens should also be processed for the same 
        amount of time as meat, but most vegetables, such as asparagus, beets, 
        and carrots, are best processed for 30 minutes for pints and 40 minutes 
        for quarts. </p>
      <p>Refer to your canning recipe book for additional instructions for the 
        foods that you are canning. Whether you are canning with a boiling water 
        bath, or a pressure canner, the instructions should be followed closely. 
        If your canning instructions or recipes vary from the general instructions 
        given here, you should use the instructions that came with your canning 
        equipment or recipe book. Food poisoning from home canning is rare, but 
        improperly canned foods can cause botulism which can be life-threatening. 
        You do not need to worry as long as you follow the instructions carefully, 
        particular with regard to sterilization procedures and processing times 
        and temperatures.</p>

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_27">Freezing</h3>
      <p><font size="+1">Freezing is an easy and convenient method of food preservation. 
        It is also very good at retaining the nutritional value of your foods. 
        </font>To prepare fresh vegetables for freezing they must be blanched 
        first to stop the enzymatic activity that can cause the nutritional value 
        and quality of your food to deteriorate. To blanch vegetables drop them 
        into a pot of boiling water. Leave them for a minute or two to allow the 
        water to come back to a boil. Then quickly stop the cooking process by 
        removing them from the boiling water and dropping them into ice water. 
        Once cooled they are ready to put into freezer bags, squeezing as much 
        air out of the bag as possible, and then into your freezer. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">There is one obvious disadvantage to freezing which we 
        discussed at the beginning of this chapter. When the electricity goes 
        off so does your freezer, unless you have invested in a gasoline or propane-powered 
        generator</font>. If you are a hunter or have a garden and prefer freezing 
        to other preservation techniques that is fine. Hopefully, during an emergency, 
        you will be able to consume the foods in your freezer before they spoil. 
        But you should also have a stash of foods that do not require freezing 
        for those longer emergencies.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">If you do use a freezer to store some of your food, remember 
        that loss of power does not have to mean the loss of your food, even if 
        you don't have a generator.</font> The food in a full freestanding freezer 
        will be safe for about two days after the power goes out, providing you 
        don't open the door too much. A chest-type freezer is much more desirable 
        than an upright freezer. Cold air is heavier than warm air, and the cold 
        air tends to stay in a chest-type freezer longer. When you open the door 
        of an upright freezer all of the cold air &quot;falls out&quot; of the 
        freezer in a matter of seconds. A half-full freezer will keep your frozen 
        foods safe for about one day after the power goes off. If your freezer 
        isn't full, group the frozen foods together forming a pyramid so that 
        they can protect each other. Put meat and poultry to one side so their 
        juices won't contaminate the other foods when they begin to thaw. (Do 
        this beforehand because when the power goes off you will want to have 
        the freezer door open as little as possible.) Remember that the foods 
        at greatest risk are meat, poultry and foods containing dairy products 
        such as milk, cream, sour cream and soft cheese.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">If your freezer is not full, it is a very good idea to 
        fill some of the empty space with plastic bottles filled about three quarters 
        full of water.</font> (Don't fill the bottles completely because water 
        expands as it is freezes.) Two and three liter soda bottles work great. 
        Once the water is frozen, it won't take any additional energy to keep 
        it that way, and the fuller your freezer is the more efficiently it will 
        operate. When the power goes out your frozen foods will remain frozen 
        much longer (the same as if your freezer were filled with frozen foods.) 
        The frozen bottled water may also serve as emergency drinking water.</p>

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_1E">Conservation of Food</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">Food can be thought of as a form of stored energy.</font> 
        Plants store energy from the sun and animals get it from plants. Since 
        the beginning of life, survival has depended on the organisms ability 
        to efficiently use and conserve energy. </p>
      <p>Until recent years humans have by necessity been conservative users of 
        energy, but the availability of cheap and abundant fossil fuels has changed 
        that. Chemical fertilizers made from natural gas and farm equipment powered 
        by diesel fuel has allowed industrialized nations to produce an abundance 
        of inexpensive food. People at one end of the nation have been able to 
        enjoy fresh foods that were grown at the other end, and at extremely low 
        costs thanks to refrigerated trucks. After decades of such a cheap energy 
        bonanza, Americans, and others living in industrialized regions, have 
        developed wasteful habits. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">It has been estimated that American families throw out 
        from 8 to 20% of the food they buy.</font> That adds up to about $4.5 
        billion worth of wasted food a year. But even more is wasted by food wholesalers, 
        distributors and retailers. Billions of dollars worth of good food&#151;from 
        the slightly bruised apple to the misshapen zucchini&#151;is simply thrown 
        out. One broken egg and the whole dozen is discarded! As a result of this 
        waste, grocery store dumpsters are often loaded with good food, which 
        many economically-minded people have discovered, some even going as far 
        as making regular forages through grocery store dumpsters to reclaim some 
        of this discarded bounty.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\groceryproduce.jpg"><img src="img\groceryproduce.jpg" width="512" height="293" border="0" alt="Grocery store produce"></a></p>
      <p>As a result of decades of abundant cheap energy, we have come to expect 
        our grocery stores to be stocked with fresh produce regardless of the 
        season. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">During a prolonged emergency we will need to discard 
        our wasteful habits rather than our good food. </font>Foods that we cannot 
        eat can be used to fatten up livestock, which will provide a source of 
        protein. We can compost what the animals won't eat to recycle the nutrients 
        and minerals back into the garden, eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers.</p>
      <p>During an emergency there will be many other ways that you can conserve 
        food, especially if you have made a few preparations. For example, when 
        a large animal is butchered there is likely to be a great deal of meat 
        that you will not be able to consume immediately. If you are without electricity 
        you will not be able to freeze it either. However, if you have a heat 
        source you may be able to pressure can some of the meat. Meat is cooked 
        in the process of pressure canning so it will be ready to eat right out 
        of the mason jar. Meat can also be salted, smoked or dried and made into 
        jerky. This can even be done using solar energy.</p>
      <p>Most Americans give little thought to food conservation. Experience has 
        shown that old habits are hard to break, so even during lean times there 
        will be individuals who will waste good food while going hungry. Their 
        loss may be your gain, if you are willing to scrounge. Recently a deer 
        was struck and killed by an automobile down the street from my home. A 
        neighbor witnessed the accident and, being a deer hunter, knew exactly 
        what to do. That meat did not go to waste</p>

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_28">A Final Thought About Food: Recycling</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">Other than the obvious (i.e., eating &quot;leftovers&quot;), 
        just how do you recycle food? Remember that food is stored energy, and 
        energy is the key to survival. Even the parts of our foods that we do 
        not eat contain stored energy as well as useful nutrients</font>. As we 
        saw earlier one way to recycle this food is by feeding it to livestock. 
        Corn husks can be fed to rabbits, for example. Due to their unique digestive 
        systems rabbits can digest plant parts that humans can not. In turn the 
        rabbits will provide a source of high-quality easily digestible protein.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">As we also discussed in another section of this web site, 
        you can recycle food waste by composting as well.</font> Composting makes 
        use of naturally occurring bacteria to break down food, and other organic 
        materials, turning it back into rich soil. The composted soil can then 
        be worked into your garden providing natural fertilizer.</p>
      <p>I should mention here that one thing that I do not recommend recycling 
        is human fecal matter. Human waste contains harmful bacteria that can 
        cause dysentery or cholera which can make you very sick or even kill you. 
        Do not use human waste as a fertilizer for any plants which are going 
        to be consumed by humans. Animal manure is an entirely different story. 
        Rabbit manure, as we have seen, is the best fertilizer available and won't 
        burn your plants even when worked directly into the soil. The manure of 
        other herbivores, such as cows and horses, is also very desirable for 
        your plants. The manure of meat eating animals, such as dogs and cats, 
        should be avoided in your compost and in your garden because they can 
        harbor dangerous parasites.</p>
