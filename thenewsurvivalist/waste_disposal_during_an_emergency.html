      <p><font size="+1">The new survivalist may be tempted to dismiss the topic 
        of waste disposal as mundane and unimportant. </font>Certainly it isn't 
        as sexy as bug out bags or solar cookers. In industrialized societies 
        most of us take our sewage disposal for granted. We simply flush the toilet 
        and forget about it. But the modern sewage and water treatment facilities 
        that we take for granted today are largely responsible for the increased 
        life spans that we enjoy, and have done more to prevent death and disease 
        than all the doctors, drugs, and hospitals in the world combined!</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Throughout history, many millions of people have died 
        from diseases such as cholera and dysentery, acquired from water contaminated 
        by human waste. </font>Even today, according to the World Health Organization, 
        water borne diseases are responsible for the deaths of 4,000 children 
        every day! <b><font color="#000066">Water contaminated by fecal matter 
        is the single largest cause of disease in the world, and is killing over 
        4 million people each year with diarrhea and intestinal parasites.</font></b> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">We also take our garbage collection services for granted, 
        until our garbage collectors go on strike and in a matter of days our 
        streets are filled with waste.</font> Many of the great plagues that have 
        struck humankind have been the result of poor sanitation. The Bubonic 
        Plague, or Black Death, which spread from China through Europe during 
        the Middle Ages, was transmitted to humans by fleas which were carried 
        by rodents. The accumulation of garbage in the streets, and the resulting 
        proliferation of rats, contributed largely to the deaths caused by the 
        Black Death. <font color="#000066"><b>The Black Death wiped out one third 
        of the population of Europe! </b></font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">I hope by now you understand why this topic is important 
        enough to give some serious thought. </font>What will you do when your 
        sewage backs up because your local municipality can no longer provide 
        the service? What will you do with your garbage when it begins to pile 
        up in the street? <font color="#000066"><b>According to the U.S. Environmental 
        Protection Agency, the average American disposes of 4.6 pounds of garbage 
        every day! </b></font></p>

      <p><font size="+1">What if you don't have a composting toilet?</font> If 
        your home is equipped with a good septic tank you will not have to rely 
        on the municipal system for your sewage disposal. Consider yourself lucky. 
        Try to keep toilet paper use to a minimum to prevent your system from 
        clogging up. If you run out of toilet paper and can't buy more, you will 
        probably be using any kind of paper that you can find. Whether you use 
        a septic tank or a municipal system, don't flush it down the toilet! You 
        will surely clog the system. I recommend that you burn or bury your improvised 
        toilet paper instead. This may be inconvenient, but I assure you it will 
        be better than having your system back up, in which case you will be burying 
        more than your paper!</p>
      <p>In 1979, I was a college student on summer break hitchhiking across Europe. 
        I spent some time as a guest on a vegetarian commune located in a old 
        castle in rural Southern France. When I went to the basement to use the 
        bathroom I saw the familiar squat toilets that were common in France, 
        but there was no toilet paper to be found anywhere. There was however 
        a convenient water spigot located next to each toilet. When I asked for 
        the toilet paper I was told that they didn't use it but washed themselves 
        with water instead. They claimed that not only was this much better for 
        the septic system, it was also more hygienic. So for the two weeks that 
        I stayed on the commune I did &quot;as the Romans do.&quot; That was not 
        a practice that I continued after leaving the commune, but it did show 
        me that people can get along just fine without toilet paper when they 
        have to (as long as there is plenty of water for washing.) By the way, 
        I don't recommend recycling that water!</p>
      <p>Even if your sewer system continues to work after an emergency, if your 
        municipal water is interrupted you will have to flush your toilet by pouring 
        a bucket of water down it. If water is in short supply, don't try to flush 
        the toilet after each use. You will want to flush it after defecation 
        I'm sure, but several people can urinate in the toilet before it has to 
        be flushed. You can recycle your &quot;gray water&quot; by using it to 
        flush your toilet. As we saw earlier, &quot;gray water&quot; is water 
        that has already been used at least once for washing&#151;the water you 
        just bathed with or used to wash your dishes for example. It is called 
        &quot;gray water&quot; because the residual dirt and soap give it a grayish 
        appearance.</p>
      <p>What will you do if your sewer or septic system backs up? After cleaning 
        up the mess, you will have to bury your waste. Remember that many deadly 
        diseases are spread by water that has been contaminated by human waste, 
        so make sure that you do not contaminate any water supply. (You will probably 
        have neighbors who will not be as thoughtful, so you will have to be careful 
        about the water you drink, as we discussed in the chapter on water.) Discourage 
        people from defecating near any water source used by people or animals, 
        or in fields where crops are grown.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">One way to dispose of your waste is to build an outhouse 
        or latrine. The familiar outhouse building with the crescent moon on the 
        door is for privacy and is therefore optional. The only thing that is 
        really needed is a deep pit in which you can dispose of your waste.</font> 
        A hundred years ago it was common for people to keep a &quot;slop jar&quot; 
        with a securely fitting lid beside their beds for nighttime use when the 
        weather was too cold to venture outdoors. The next morning someone would 
        empty the slop jars into the outhouse pit. If you prefer you too can &quot;go&quot; 
        in a pot inside your house and then carry the waste to your latrine for 
        disposal.</p>

        The older type made of metal (on the left) and the newer type made of 
        plastic both contain removable buckets for carrying the waste to the latrine.</p>

      <h4>Construction of a Latrine</h4>
      <p><font size="+1">Latrines should be situated and constructed so as to 
        minimize the risk of groundwater contamination. </font>There should be 
        at least 50 feet (15 meters) between your latrine and any water source, 
        such as a well, stream or lake. If you have a well, locate the latrine 
        on lower ground or &quot;downhill&quot; from it if possible. It should 
        also be located where it will not be flooded by storm water, which could 
        contaminate any local water supply. The top of the latrine should be raised 
        or built up at least 6 inches (.15 meters) above ground level to prevent 
        rainwater from entering the pit. It should have a tight-fitting lid so 
        insects and animals can not enter it. Mosquitos will breed in the pit 
        if water accumulates at the bottom. If insects can not be kept out the 
        excreta should be covered with 4 inches (.1 meter) of soil every two or 
        three days.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Your pit should be 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep.</font> Holes 
        for outhouses with a superstructure over them are normally dug about 3.5 
        feet (1 meter) square. If your latrine is simply a hole in the ground 
        you may not want to make it that wide but you should try to make it deep. 
        Keep it covered with a board that completely covers the pit and is sturdy 
        enough for someone to walk on. By all means do whatever is necessary to 
        insure that people and animals do not fall into the pit.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">When the pit fills up, simply dig another one close by 
        and move your latrine or outhouse to the new pit.</font> Use the dirt 
        from the new hole to fill in the old one making a mound on top because 
        it will settle as the waste decomposes. From time to time you will need 
        to add additional dirt as the old pit settles. Be careful to avoid underground 
        utility lines when digging your latrines. (Your local utility companies 
        will show you where they are located on your property. All you have to 
        do is call them and request this free service.)</p>

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_3">Reduce</h3>
      <p><font size="+1">The most desirable option for garbage management is to 
        reduce the amount you produce.</font> If you eat everything on your plate 
        you will obviously have less to throw out. But what about the packaging? 
        You can't eat a cardboard box. The problem will be partially solved by 
        choosing foods with less packaging. The more a food is processed the more 
        packaging it seems to require. Fresh and natural foods generally have 
        little if any packaging. So not only is it healthier for you to choose 
        foods with minimal processing, it is healthier for the environment as 
        well. Choose natural, whole foods whenever possible. If anything remains 
        after the fresh food is consumed it can be fed to animals or composted. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>It seems like half the trash I throw out is junk mail. Hopefully, during 
        an emergency, when the garbage collection services are temporarily interrupted, 
        the junk mail will be interrupted as well. If not, we could all end up 
        buried in junk mail! If you want to reduce the junk mail that you receive 
        you can contact the Direct Marketing Association's (DMA) Mail Preference 
        Service at their web site at: <a href="http://www.dmachoice.org">http://www.dmachoice.org</a>. 
        There is a $1 fee but I have heard that the service is very effective 
        at reducing your junk mail. Just consider the small fee a contribution 
        to help protect the environment. If you are tired of receiving credit 
        card offers in the mail the three national credit bureaus offer a toll-free 
        number that you can call to opt-out of credit offers. Call 1-888-5-OPTOUT 
        (1-888-567-8688) for more information.</p>
      <p> In the section on food storage I mentioned that my favorite method for 
        long-term storage is canned food. If you can your own foods there will 
        be no problem with waste disposal, because you will reuse your glass jars. 
        But what about the canned foods that you buy from the store? If your community 
        provides a recycling service you should certainly recycle your cans rather 
        than throw them in the trash. But what will you do during a prolonged 
        emergency when these types of services are interrupted? Unfortunately 
        I have not found a perfect solution to this problem. If you consume store-bought 
        canned foods you are going to produce some garbage. I believe however 
        that the benefits of using canned foods for your emergency stash far outweigh 
        this inconvenience, so canned foods remain my preferred method of food 
        storage.</p>

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_4">Reuse </h3>
      <p> What is the difference between reusing and recycling? I will answer 
        that question with an example: After you drink a bottle of water, if you 
        throw the empty bottle in the recycle bin you are obviously recycling. 
        But a far better option would be to refill the bottle, perhaps using water 
        from your own water filter. A lot of energy is required to crush and melt 
        old bottles to convert them into new bottles. But very little is required 
        to reuse a plastic or glass bottle. You simply wash it out and reuse it!</p>

      <p>Recycling is the least desirable of the three R's but it is far better 
        than simply throwing your trash away&#151;wasting natural resources and 
        contributing to land fill problems. I have already mentioned ways that 
        we can recycle our food waste. Many parts of the foods that we can't eat 
        can be fed to animals to fatten them up, providing us with a good source 
        of protein. The plant wastes that our animals can't consume can be composted, 
        providing rich nutrients that are returned to the soil, reducing our dependence 
        on chemical fertilizers</p>

        use the three R's mentioned above to take care of most of what remains. 
        But there will no doubt be some small amount of garbage that you will 
        have to get rid of. That is where the <b>&quot;two B's of garbage disposal&quot;</b> 
        come into play: <b>Burn it or Bury it! </b></p>

      <p>Some trash that can not be reused or recycled can be burned, possibly 
        providing energy that can be used for warmth or cooking. The use of covered 
        enclosures like this chimenia are preferable to burning in the open because 
        they reduce the risk of wildfires. Some municipalities will allow outdoor 
        burning only in covered enclosures like this one. Outdoor burning should 
        be avoided when conditions are very dry and/or windy due to the risk of 
        wildfires.</p>
