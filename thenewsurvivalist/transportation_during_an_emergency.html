      <p><font size="+1">What will you do when you run out of gasoline and there 
        is no more at the filling stations? I am going to assume that a horse 
        or horse-drawn carriage is impractical for you. Unless you have a farm 
        or ranch and already enjoy horseback riding, I am not going to recommend 
        that you include one in your survival stash. For one thing, they eat...well, 
        like a horse!</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">I also do not recommend that you stockpile gasoline, 
        at least not more than perhaps one or two 5-gallon cans. It is too dangerous. 
        Gasoline also does not keep well.</font> It starts going bad after about 
        a year in storage. If you do choose to store a small amount of gasoline 
        be sure to rotate it out, using it in your vehicle and replacing what 
        you have in storage every 6 months or so. Gasoline additives are available 
        at automotive supply stores that help stabilize gasoline, increasing its 
        storage life somewhat. Diesel oil is much more stable than gasoline and 
        more suitable for storage. It is also less volatile and therefore less 
        dangerous to keep around. But even diesel fuel should not be stored for 
        more than a few years.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">If you have a motorcycle or scooter you will be able 
        to get more miles out of each gallon of gasoline that you are able to 
        scrounge up during an emergency. </font>As soon as the filling stations 
        run out of gas, you will want to park your car and use your motorcycle 
        instead. A siphon hose suitable for gasoline should be a part of your 
        survival stash. For as long as it lasts you can use the gasoline in your 
        car as your supply for your motorcycle. But conservation is important. 
        You will want to keep some of your gasoline for your garden tiller.</p>

      <p>I get about 75 to 80 miles per gallon of gasoline (about 3 liters per

      <p>Bicycling is one of the most efficient means of transportation allowing

      <p>You can also haul a fair amount on a bicycle or motorcycle if you have 
        a transit rack and/or saddle bag type panniers. Your survival stash should 
        include a good well-maintained bicycle for each member of your family 
        along with the tools and accessories needed to keep them running smoothly, 
        including a tire repair kit and pump. It is also a good idea to stockpile 
        extra tires and inner tubes.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Do you know what the most common mode of transportation 
        in China is today?</font> If you are thinking bicycles you are wrong. 
        The most common mode of transportation is walking. When we run out of 
        gasoline we will no doubt be doing a lot of walking. We should all have 
        good well-fitted walking shoes and/or hiking boots appropriate for each 
        season. An extra pair or two in your survival stash along with plenty 
        of good socks could prove most useful. You should also have good walking 
        boots that are appropriate for freezing and wet conditions along with 
        thick wool socks. Unlike many other materials wool provides good insulation 
        against the cold even when it is wet. <font color="#000066"><b>Good walking 
        shoes and socks are very important for the survivalist so don't neglect 
        this important detail.</b></font></p>
      <p>Blister formation can be minimized by insuring that your shoes fit well 
        and by wearing good socks. But some blistering will no doubt be inevitable 
        so be sure to stock up on mole skins. Every first aid kit that you own, 
        especially the small ones that you put in your bug out bags, should include 
        a supply of mole skins along with scissors for cutting them to the appropriate 
        sizes. Take care of any sores that you get on your feet immediately, no 
        matter how small. Don't let a minor foot problem become a major one. Take 
        good care of your feet!</p>

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_1">In Case of Evacuation</h2>
      <p>For years I lived in Gulfport, Mississippi, and so I have experienced 
        many city evacuations due to hurricane threats. Fortunately, these days 
        hurricane landfalls are predicted days in advance. When an evacuation 
        is recommended some people choose to leave right away while others wait 
        until the last minute. And of course if the threat does not appear too 
        great many people choose to stay. Many store shelves are emptied as people 
        stock up on emergency provisions at the last minute. Since everyone does 
        not try to leave the city at the same time evacuations are quite orderly 
        and most go smoothly. There are traffic jams on the highways but the traffic 
        usually continues moving, somewhat slowly perhaps, but since it is generally 
        many hours before the hurricane will make landfall everything usually 
        goes quite well and there is rarely a panic. </p>
      <p>I can imagine quite a different scenario if everyone were to attempt 
        to evacuate a large city at the same time&#151;and in a hurry due to a 
        panic! Imagine the worst rush hour traffic jam that you have ever experienced, 
        and then multiply that by 100, and then throw in a panic! Everything will 
        come to a complete standstill. People in a panic and will do crazy things. 
        Automobiles, engines idling for hours, will run out of fuel and lanes 
        and exits will be blocked. Others will try to drive around slow or stalled 
        vehicles, perhaps even using their cars as battering rams. Accidents will 
        be everywhere and some people will become violent and dangerous. It will 
        not be a pretty picture! <font color="#000066"><b>If you are on a motorcycle 
        you will be in a better position because it will be easier for you to 
        maneuver around stalled vehicles. </b></font></p>

    <td bordercolor="#CC3300"> 
      <p><font size="+1">As I have stated before, if at all possible, you should 
        batten down rather than bug out. In most circumstances you will be much 
        better off in the safety of your home, along with your survival supplies, 
        rather than in the streets battling it out with desperate people in a 
        panic.</font> I am not advocating that you ignore evacuation orders, especially 
        when the threat is as dangerous as a hurricane or forest fire. But every 
        emergency is different, and you should use your own judgment when deciding 
        on the best course of action, rather than relying entirely on government 
        officials. Be well aware of what you may be facing if you choose to hit 
        the streets.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">If you absolutely have to evacuate, your family will 
        be ready with your well-stocked bug out bags. </font>Each family member 
        will grab his or her bug out bag, throw it in the car, and off you will 
        go ahead of the crowds. <b><font color="#000066">Hopefully you will not 
        have to stop for fuel, for the lines will be long. That is a good reason 
        for always keeping your vehicle's fuel tank filled, rather than running 
        around all the time with only half a tank or less. Don't plan on stopping 
        at the store! The lines will be long there too and you will be wasting 
        valuable time.</font></b> That's why everyone in your family has a bug 
        out bag in the first place. Neither will you have to stop by the bank 
        or ATM because you will also have plenty of cash as part of the emergency 
        supplies in your bug out bags.</p>

        someone will be waiting for your arrival. You do not want to become a

        Hurricane Katrina what it is like to be a refugee of the state!</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Be prepared to leave your vehicle if you absolutely have 
        to. That is why everyone has his or her own individual bug out bag, so 
        each person can carry some supplies</font>. Everyone should also be equipped 
        with good walking shoes and plenty of clothing appropriate for the current 
        weather conditions. Have a portable shelter, such as a small tent, or 
        at least a small tarpaulin or sheet of plastic with which you can make 
        a lean-to shelter. Leaving your car will be an absolute last resort, but 
        you never know what you will be facing when you are forced to hit the 
        streets. You should be prepared for even the worst case scenario. </p>

      so you will know for sure where your track leads, and by all means watch 
      out for trains. You might even be able to hop on a slow-moving freight train. 
      But don't count on it. That could be very dangerous so don't risk it if 
      the train is moving the least bit too fast or it if seems too dangerous 
      for any other reason. I hope by now you can appreciate the importance of
