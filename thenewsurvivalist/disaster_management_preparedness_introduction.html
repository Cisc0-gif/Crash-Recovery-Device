      <h2 id="mbp_toc_1" align="left">A Lesson from Katrina</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">On August 29, 2005, the Gulf Coast states were struck 
        by the worst hurricane in U.S. history.</font> Hurricane Katrina, a category 
        5 storm, devastated Southern Mississippi and Louisiana leaving over 1,800 
        people dead. Another 1,800 were reported missing. Storm surges breached 
        the levees of New Orleans resulting in massive flooding. Thousands of 
        people were driven from their homes and many were stranded by rising waters. 
        The impact of the disaster was enormous in both human and economic terms. 
        The Bush Administration initially asked Congress for $105 billion for 
        reparations, but the full economic impact of the disaster would eventually 
        prove to be even greater, due to its effects on the region's industries 
        and to massive environmental damage.</p>
      <p>To the residents who were caught in the aftermath of the storm, Katrina 
        was a lesson in the inadequacy of local, state and federal governments, 
        who failed to respond in a timely manner during their time of desperate 
        need. While thousands of residents were stranded without food or water, 
        overwhelmed law enforcement officials were forced to turn their attention 
        from rescue efforts to mob control. Looting was widespread throughout 
        New Orleans and gunfire was reported in many parts of the city. Eye witnesses 
        reported incidents of murder, rape and robbery occurring in the streets, 
        even during daylight hours. There were also reports of abuse and looting 
        on the part of some law enforcement officials.</p>
      <p>Hurricane victims in Mississippi did not experience crime and violence 
        to the extent of that felt in New Orleans, but they did experience the 
        same frustrations as far as rescue and relief efforts were concerned. 
        In the weeks and months that followed the disaster, government officials 
        and agencies would be harshly criticized for the inadequacies that came 
        to light during this emergency. </p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="+2">&quot;Trust Yourself, 
        Not the Government&quot; &#151;Ron Paul </font><font color="#0000FF"><a href="http://wp.me/p37k3-lH" target="blank">Farewell 
        address to Congress, Nov. 14, 2012 (Read)</a></font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">For those of us interested in disaster preparedness, 
        a lot can be learned from Katrina. Perhaps the most important lesson is:</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Don't rely on the government! Each individual must 
        take responsibility for his or her own emergency preparedness!</b></font></p>
      <p>For days after Katrina, people were stranded on their rooftops with no 
        food or drinking water, as toxic flood waters surrounded and engulfed 
        their homes. How much better off would those individuals have been if 
        they had made a few simple preparations in advance? What if, as they had 
        been forced to leave their homes, they had grabbed their &quot;bug out&quot; 
        bags stashed with food, water and other emergency supplies, such as signaling 
        devices or flashlights? How many lives would have been saved if each individual 
        had simply made adequate provisions for emergency drinking water?</p>
      <p>As devastating as the storm was, Katrina was a disaster that affected 
        only one area of the nation. Over 95% of the country was not directly 
        touched by the storm, and many people would eventually be able to lend 
        a helping hand to its victims. But what would we do in the event of a 
        nationwide disaster? In such a catastrophe we might not be able to rely 
        on help from our friends in neighboring states, for they might be as bad 
        off as we are. Instead of taking days to respond, we might not see emergency 
        relief for weeks or even months! In such an emergency there could be a 
        complete breakdown in law enforcement and governmental infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The reader may think that such a nationwide emergency is unlikely in 
        a modern society such as ours. But as you will see in the chapters that 
        follow, not only is it possible, but some experts believe that such a 
        disaster could be imminent, perhaps even within the next decade. Furthermore, 
        in the current economic environment in which nations are dependent upon 
        trade with other nations, a far-reaching disaster will probably not be 
        limited by national borders. A national emergency could easily become 
        a global one!</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="img\nationalguard2.jpg" width="607" height="242"></p>
      <p>After a disaster the local police are usually overwhelmed, so the National 
        Guard is often dispatched to help. But during a national emergency even 
        the National Guard may be overwhelmed. (All photographs are by the author

      <h2 id="mbp_toc_2" align="left">Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Management</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">The premise of this web site is that every able individual 
        should take responsibility for his or her disaster preparedness, rather 
        than rely on others, such as the local, state or federal government, to 
        do it for them</font>. No one will ever have more interest in your welfare 
        than you. If you are prepared when a disaster strikes, you will not only 
        be better able to help yourself, you will also be able to lend a helping 
        hand to others, and the authorities will be better able to concentrate 
        their efforts where it is needed most, on search and rescue efforts for 
        example. </p>
      <p>The steps you will take to meet your preparedness goals will depend on 
        the types of emergencies or disasters that you think are possible for 
        your area. You might perceive an earthquake to be one of your greatest 
        threats, while my fears might include a dirty nuclear bomb set off by 
        terrorists. Although much of our preparedness efforts will be same&#151;we 
        will both need to stash food and water for example&#151;I might also want 
        to build a fallout shelter in my basement and stow away a Geiger counter. 
        You will probably perceive these as unnecessary steps, preferring instead 
        to earthquake-proof your home. </p>
      <p>In addition to the types of emergency items that we will choose to store, 
        the quantity that we will want to stash will depend on how long we think 
        our emergencies could last. It will therefore be beneficial at this time 
        to explore the various kinds of emergencies or disasters that we might 
        see as threats to our survival.</p>

        your neighbors. Another example would be the derailment of a freight train 
        resulting in the release of toxic gases from a tanker car into your neighborhood 
        and surrounding area. Other examples would include floods and forest fires. 
      <p><b class="level3" id="mbp_toc_9">Regional Disasters</b> effect a larger 
        area but are limited to one region of the country. Hurricane Katrina was 
        an example of a regional disaster. Other examples would include earthquakes, 
        droughts and crop failures. 
      <p><b class="level3" id="mbp_toc_A">National Disasters</b> as the name implies 
        would affect the entire nation. A war would be an example. Other examples 
        would include an economic depression, severe stock market crash or collapse 
        of the currency. 
      <p><b class="level3" id="mbp_toc_B">Global Disasters </b> affect the entire 
        planet. In today's global economy it would be easy for a national disaster 
        to quickly escalate to a global one. An economic depression in the US, 
        for example, would affect our trading partners as well. With the US dollar 
        acting as the major reserve currency for most of the world, a collapse 
        of the currency would be disastrous for nearly every nation, including 
        those as far off as China and Japan. In fact, never before in history 
        has the potential for a human-caused disaster of global proportions been 
        more possible. In our highly-mobile society it is also very possible for 
        a natural disaster, such as an epidemic, to quickly spread around the 
        globe becoming a pandemic. Furthermore, according to many scientists, 
        human activities, such as pollution, radioactive contamination, chemtrails, 
        and genetically-modified organisms (GMO) to name just a few, are threatening 
        the delicate ecological balance that has existed on the Earth for millions 
        of years. 
      <p>As we have seen, the amount of provisions that you will want to store 
        will depend on how long you anticipate an emergency could last, which 
        in turn will depend on the magnitude or scope of the disasters that you 
        consider possible for your area. If a hurricane hits your community, a 
        one-week supply of food and water will probably be sufficient, for certainly 
        help will arrive within a week. But a collapse of the currency, resulting 
        in a global disaster, might require that you store enough supplies to 
        last for months. </p>

      <p> 
      <p><font size="+2" color="#0000CC">A. </font><font size="+1">In your Action 
        Planner</font>, under the heading &quot;Disasters or Emergencies that 
        Concern Me:&quot; you should have a list, which you made in Action Step 
        1, of both the human-caused and natural disasters that you would like 
        to be prepared for with a few lines of space between each one. Now consider 
        each item on your list and write in the space below it what you would 
        anticipate the magnitude or scope of the emergency would be, whether local, 
        regional, national or global. If you find the item in a gray area between 
        two categories, move up to the category involving the larger scope. For 
        example, if you have &quot;earthquake&quot; on your list and are not sure 
        whether it will be a local disaster or a regional one, go ahead and put 
        it down as a regional disaster. If you are prepared for a major earthquake 
        which might knock out local services, such as water and electricity, for 
        one month, then you should find a smaller earthquake that would result 
        in a loss of services for two or three days to be easy to handle. But 
        if you are only prepared for two or three days, then you are going to 
        be very uncomfortable if your services are not restored until a full month 
        after the event! It is far better to be over-prepared than under. In fact, 
        you could probably never be over-prepared for any emergency. </p>

      <p><font size="+2" color="#0000CC">B. </font><font size="+1">In your Action 
        Planner</font>, for each item that you wrote in step A, write down what 
        you would anticipate the most likely <b>duration</b> would be for that 
        disaster or emergency. Keep in mind that the duration will depend on the 
        scope or magnitude of the emergency. A local disaster, such as a tornado, 
        might result in the loss of services for a few days. A regional disaster, 
        such as an earthquake (or a hurricane like Katrina) might result in the 
        loss of services for a few weeks or even a month or two. A national or 
        global disaster might result in a loss of services for many months.</p>
      <p>You now have a list of the disasters or emergencies that you perceive 
        to be your greatest threats, and an idea of the magnitude and duration 
        that those disasters are likely to involve. You will use this information 
        to help you decide on how long a siege you will want to be prepared for 
        and how many provisions you will want to store. Congratulations! You have 
        accomplished an important first step toward your preparedness goals. You 
        are already far ahead of the crowd! You are now ready to continue to the 
        next chapter, where we will explore the importance of having a plan, and 
        help you accomplish the next important step toward your preparedness goals.</p>
