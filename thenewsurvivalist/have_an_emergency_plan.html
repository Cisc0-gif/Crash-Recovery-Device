      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_1">Have a Plan</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">It is important to have an emergency plan of action and 
        to familiarize every family member with it. This will insure that important 
        steps will get done as quickly and efficiently as possible after a disaster 
        strikes. It will also instill a sense of confidence in all family members, 
        so instead of the feelings of helplessness, panic and chaos that unprepared 
        individuals will face, your family will remain confident, calm and organized. 
        The actions taken during the first few minutes and hours after a disaster 
        will often turn out to be critical, perhaps even saving a life.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Does everyone in your family know what to do when there 
        is a natural gas leak in your house?</font> Earthquakes, tornadoes and 
        similar disasters can result in a rupture of a natural gas pipe. If not 
        taken care of immediately this could result in an explosion that could 
        destroy your home and everything in it! You should locate the main valve 
        that shuts off the gas to your house, usually located outside next to 
        your gas meter. You will need a large wrench. Acquire a wrench just for 
        this purpose and make sure that everyone in your family knows how to shut 
        the gas off. (Don't actually shut it off if you have pilot lights in any 
        of your gas appliances or they will have to be re-lit when you turn the 
        gas back on.) The gas valve is often difficult to turn, so you will need 
        a wrench large enough to provide sufficient leverage. Store this wrench 
        in a location that can be easily accessed in times of emergency, near 
        a back door entrance or in an outside shed for example. I have my wrench 
        hanging on the wall in my garden shed with the words &quot;For Gas Shutoff&quot; 
        written in large letters on the wall above it. Every family member should 
        know the location of this wrench and how to use it. I recommend that you 
        refrain from using this wrench for any other purpose, to insure that it 
        will always remain in its proper place and ready for an emergency.</p>
      <p>It is also a good idea to familiarize every family member with what to 
        do in case there is a ruptured water pipe in your house. Locate the main 
        valve that shuts the water off to your entire house and make sure that 
        every family member knows how to close it. Sometimes this valve is located 
        inside the house, perhaps in the basement where the main water line enters 
        the house. If there is no such shut off valve in your house you will have 
        to shut the water off at the meter, which may be outside your house. This 
        will require a special tool that will reach all the way down to the valve 
        because outside water meters are located deep enough to remain below the 
        freeze level. Keep this wrench in a special location like the gas wrench 
        and make sure that everyone in your family knows where it is and how to 
        use it.</p>
      <p>Every home should have a good fire extinguisher located on each level 
        of the house. These should be regularly maintained and kept in good working 
        order. Battery operated smoke detectors should also be appropriately located 
        at all levels of your home and their batteries should be checked regularly. 
        I also recommend an electronic carbon monoxide detector.</p>
      <p>Part of your plan should also include an agreed upon place for family 
        members to meet in case your home is destroyed or otherwise uninhabitable. 
        You should also have one or two backups in case your agreed upon meeting 
        place is unavailable. Plan A, for example, may be a neighbor's house. 
        Plan B could be a nearby family member's house, and Plan C could be a 
        local public place such as a school, church or park.</p>

      Turn your Action Planner to a fresh page and at the top write &quot;Home 
      Preparation.&quot; Now draw a line down the center of the page dividing 
      it into two columns. At the top of the column on the left write &quot;Get&quot;

      <p>Add others that you can think of now and continue adding as you think 
        of others in the future. Use this as your shopping list. You might draw 
        a little box to the left of each item, as I have done in the example above, 
        and put an X or a check in the box in front of each item that you acquire.</p>
      <p>On the right side of the page under &quot;Do&quot; begin a list of the

        <li>[&nbsp; ] Have fire extinguisher maintained</li>

        <li>[&nbsp; ] Earthquake-proof water heater</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Show each family member how to shut off the gas</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Show each family member how to shut off the water</li>

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_3">To Bug Out or Hunker Down?</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">In the event of an emergency you may be faced with a 
        choice, whether you should leave your home, perhaps seeking refuge in 
        a government-run shelter, or hunker down in your home and try to deal 
        with the situation on your own.</font> If your neighborhood is under a 
        forced evacuation due to a toxic spill, or if your house has collapsed 
        or burned to the ground, you may not have a choice at all. You should 
        also consider leaving when local officials recommend evacuation in response 
        to an approaching hurricane or forest fire. <b>However, in most situations, 
        when you do have a choice, survival experts agree that you will probably 
        be better off if you can ride out the disaster in your own home rather 
        than in a government-run shelter.</b></p>
      <p>The New Orleans residents who sought shelter in the New Orleans Superdome 
        after Hurricane Katrina quickly discovered that those who rely on the 
        government often find themselves in the bleakest of situations. Not only 
        were the supplies woefully inadequate, but they also had to deal with 
        overcrowding, filth, and unhealthy conditions. There was human violence 
        including robberies and rape. Conditions were so bad that many individuals 
        became desperately depressed and one even committed suicide.</p>
      <p>You will usually be much better off if you will remain in your home surrounded 
        by the familiar objects that you use on a daily basis, and hopefully near 
        familiar neighbors who you can work with. If you remain at home you will 
        also have ready access to all of your emergency supplies, including any 
        stash of food, water, medical supplies, and sources of energy that you 
        have prepared in anticipation of just such a emergency.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Even though your goal is to remain in your home, you 
        should nevertheless prepare a &quot;bug out bag&quot; (BOB) in case you 
        are forced to leave your home. Every individual in your household should 
        have his or her own &quot;BOB,&quot; even children, as long as they are 
        capable of wearing a back pack (such as the bags they use to carry their 
        school supplies.)</font></p>
      <p>Your bug out bag should include a miniaturized version of your home survival 
        stash, limited only by the size of the bag and the weight that you can 
        reasonably carry, keeping in mind that you might be in for some walking. 
        The reason I am covering bug out bags before your home survival stash 
        is because your bug out bag should be put together first, because it can 
        also serve as your home survival stash until you have had time to accumulate 
        a larger stash.</p>

        have to &quot;bug out&quot; in order to use your bug out bag. It will 
        serve nicely as a supplement to your home survival kit, keeping your survival 
        items in one location where they can be easily accessed in time of emergency.

      <p><font size="+1">It is also important to have a survival bag located in 
        your car at all times. </font>Most people spend about a third of each 
        weekday at their place of work, and another significant portion of the 
        day traveling to and from their workplace. What will you do if the big 
        earthquake hits while you are at work, or if something happens while you 
        are driving to or from work? Your supplies stashed at home will do you 
        little good when you are stranded at work or in your car. </p>
      <p>In addition to the usual items that you would include in your bug out 
        bag at home, such as a small emergency supply of food and water, your 
        car bag should also include the items that you might need for automobile 
        emergencies, such as jumper cables, emergency flares, flashers, fix-a-flat, 
        etc. I keep two emergency bags in the trunk of my car: One is just for 
        my car, while the other contains items for my personal survival. That 
        way, if I ever have to leave my car, I can grab the bag that contains 
        only what I need to take with me, leaving the heavy car supplies in the 
        trunk of the car.</p>

        large black bag in which emergency survival items are kept (shown in the 
        following photograph.) Next is a gallon of water, which can be used either 
        for drinking or for the automobile's cooling system. Finally, on the far

        as you are putting the different BOBs together. Let each family member 
        get involved in putting his or her own BOB together. That way everyone 
        will become familiar with the contents of their own bags and any questions 
        can be addressed at that time. In addition, make a list for a Car BOB 
        or an emergency survival kit that you will keep in the trunk of your car. 
        Below is a sample list to help you put your lists together. If any of 
        these items are unfamiliar to you don't worry because I will discuss them 
        in the chapters that follow:</p>

        Kit for Your Automobile</font></h2>
      <p>In Action Step 4 you made check lists for your BOBs, including an emergency 
        survival kit to keep in your automobile. In addition to this car BOB, 
        which will contain items for your personal survival, I recommend that 
        you make a separate emergency bag to include only the items needed for 
        automobile emergencies&#151;jumper cables, fix-a-flat, etc. By keeping 
        them in a separate bag you will be able to leave these heavy items in 
        your car if you are ever forced to leave your vehicle, taking only the 
        emergency items that you will need for your personal survival. Turn to 
        a new page in your Action Planner and write &quot;Automobile Emergency

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_8">Home Caching</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">The core of your survival program will be your home cache.</font> 
        According to the dictionary a <b>cache</b> is a &quot;hiding place used 
        for storing provisions and other necessities,&quot; or alternatively, 
        &quot;a store of goods hidden in a cache.&quot; The key word here is &quot;<b>hidden,</b>&quot; 
        which I emphasize because I believe that your cache should be kept secret 
        from everyone but your closest family members. In this web site I will use 
        the words &quot;cache&quot; and &quot;stash&quot; interchangeably.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_9">Essential Survival Items</h3>
      <p>The reader will perhaps have noticed that the above list of items for 
        your bug out bag is divided into 12 categories. I will briefly describe 
        these categories below and we will explore them in much greater detail 
        throughout the remainder of this web site. I have listed them roughly in 
        their order of importance. The reason water appears before food, for example, 
        is because you can only live a few days without water, whereas you could 
        live for a few weeks without food. There could be many exceptions to this 
        ordering of course. If you are stuck outside in subfreezing weather, then 
        food and water may take a back seat to clothing and shelter. And if you 
        are bleeding profusely then first aid will certainly become number one 
        on your list. But this order will help us as we organize our lists and 
        establish our plan.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_A">1 Water</h3>
      <p><font size="+1">Clean drinking water is always the number one priority 
        for any survivalist.</font> You can count on needing at least one gallon 
        per person per day. This will only take care of your drinking needs, food 
        preparation and perhaps minimal washing and bathing (sponging off.) If 
        more water is available it will certainly come in handy, as this one gallon 
        per day does not include washing your dishes or clothes nor flushing waste 
        down your toilet (assuming your sewer system is not backed up.) <b>You 
        can readily see that two gallons per person per day would be even better.</b> 
        Clean water is so important that not only should it be stored, but plans 
        should be made for collecting it from rain and other outdoor sources such 
        as streams and ponds, and for purifying it in order to produce good drinking 
        water from the water which you collect. We will also need to recycle water 
        as much as possible. For example, when water is scarce, &quot;gray water&quot;&#151;the 
        soapy water you just used to wash with&#151;should not be thrown out right 
        away. It can be used to flush your toilet, or even to water your plants. 
        Our water stash will last much longer if we are able to reuse it, conserve 
        it, and replenish it by collecting and filtering rain or pond water.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_B">2 Food</h3>
      <p>In the following chapters we will explore the many factors that will 
        need to be considered when preparing your food stash. As with the other 
        items on our list, the amount of food that you will store will depend 
        on the anticipated duration of the emergencies that you are preparing 
        for. Food preservation methods and shelf life are always important considerations. 
        Concentrated ready-to-eat foods that do not weigh much are nice to have 
        for your bug out bags. These may include dried foods, granola bars and 
        jerky. Canned foods are usually the best choices for your home stash, 
        because they are the most economical and the additional water they contain 
        may come in handy in satisfying your body's water needs. For emergencies 
        of a longer duration we will want to consider food gathering and growing 
        techniques. Our food stash will last much longer if we are able to replenish 
        some of it.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_C">3 Clothing </h3>
      <p>If you are without electricity and natural gas your home will be colder 
        than usual during the cold months of the year, even if you have alternative 
        methods for generating heat. You may need to stash long underwear, warm 
        socks and sweaters, and other items that will help you keep warm. You 
        might have to do a lot more walking than in normal times, so good, well-fitted 
        walking shoes may prove to be one of your most important possessions.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_D">4 Shelter</h3>
      <p>Hopefully you will be able to remain in your intact home, and will thereby 
        have the best protection from the elements possible. But you might want 
        to give some thought to a backup. A portable backup shelter, such as a 
        lightweight tent, may prove very handy if you are ever forced to leave 
        your home.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_E">5 Energy</h3>
      <p>If the natural gas and electricity are off you will certainly need alternative 
        energy sources, not only to keep warm during the cold months but also 
        for cooking and preserving your food and for heating your water. An occasional 
        warm bath will certainly be a welcomed luxury during a prolonged emergency.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_F">6 Health Care</h3>
      <p>The health care category includes first aid, hygiene and prevention. 
        A well-stocked first aid kit should be a priority in all homes and every 
        adult should be acquainted with basic first aid procedures. You may also 
        need to stash necessary medicines and nutritional supplements. </p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_10">7 Protection</h3>
      <p>While disasters may bring out the best in some people, unfortunately 
        they also bring out the worst in others. During any disaster law enforcement 
        officials will be overwhelmed and chaos will often be the order of the 
        day. There are many people who will be eager to take advantage of the 
        situation, and so robbery, looting and even violent crimes will always 
        be on the increase after a disaster. You must make preparations for protecting 
        yourself, your loved ones, and your property.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_11"> 8 Communication</h3>
      <p>After any disaster you will want to know what is happening in the outside 
        world. Without electricity your usual news sources may be inaccessible. 
        At the very least a battery-operated radio with fresh batteries should 
        be included in every survival kit.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_12"> 9 Waste Disposal</h3>
      <p>The temporary interruption of municipal services is likely to include 
        your garbage collection service. Garbage can quickly accumulate creating 
        an inconvenience as well as a health threat. A lack of adequate sewage 
        disposal is particularly dangerous. Improper disposal of human waste is 
        a real threat, especially when it is released into streams or other natural 
        bodies of water&#151;the same water that many will be using for their 
        water supply when municipal water is unavailable. Cholera and amebic dysentery 
        are deadly diseases that result from contaminated water.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_13"> 10 Social</h3>
      <p>According to experienced survivalists, during a prolonged emergency our 
        chances of survival will be greatly enhanced if we are able to work cooperatively 
        with our neighbors toward our common goals. You may have little chance 
        against a marauding gang on your own. But if you and your neighbors are 
        able to stick together you will be much better able to fend them off. 
        Don't wait until a disaster strikes. The time to start developing good 
        relations with your neighbors is now!</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_14"> 11 Transportation</h3>
      <p>What will you do when gasoline is no longer available? Even if the filling 
        stations have gasoline in their storage tanks (which they probably won't) 
        they will not be able to get it from their underground tanks to your automobile 
        when the electricity is off. </p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_15">12 Money</h3>
      <p>Without electricity there will be no credit card processing nor working 
        ATM machines. Banks will be useless when their computers are off-line. 
        The stores that are still operating will take cash only.</p>
      <p> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_16">Noetic and Spiritual Needs</h3>
      <p>There is one more category that I will briefly mention here which I will 
        refer to as the noetic needs, or if you prefer the needs of the spirit. 
        This refers to the needs of the human mind and spirit which extend beyond 
        the mere survival of the body. &quot;Man does not live by bread alone,&quot; 
        as the good book says. In a prolonged emergency it is important to maintain 
        a healthy attitude. Boredom, frustration, anger, despair, and depression 
        can take their toll on any survivors. Satisfying the noetic needs can 
        help prevent many of these potential problems. For many the Holy Bible 
        may turn out to be as essential for their &quot;bug out&quot; bags as 
        their water filters. Comfort and inspiration may also be found in poetry, 
        prose, music, meditation and prayer. Children will need activities, such 
        as storytelling and games, to occupy their minds and help alleviate boredom. 
        Everyone, from the elderly to the very young, will need their own chores 
        to help them feel connected and needed. We are less likely to dwell on 
        our own problems when we are busy helping others, so never overlook charity. 
        Assign non-essential individuals chores that involve helping others, and 
        you will find that they are no longer non-essential. The personal accounts 
        of holocaust victims show us that those with a spiritual grounding have 
        a much better chance of surviving difficult circumstances, so whatever 
        this may mean for you, get your spiritual house in order before disaster 
        strikes!</p>
