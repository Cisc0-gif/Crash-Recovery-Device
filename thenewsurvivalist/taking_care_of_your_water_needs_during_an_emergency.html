        of the planet's surface.</font> Ninety-seven percent of the earth's water 
        is in the oceans, but that water is not readily available for human use 
        because of its high salt content. Of the 3% that consists of fresh water, 
        two thirds is locked in glacial and polar ice. That leaves only 1% of 
        the earth's water available for human use. </p>

      <p>Scientists believe that life began in the oceans. If that is true, then 
        we apparently took part of the oceans with us when we left our watery 
        birthplace, for fully 70% of the human body is made up of water. A newborn's 
        body consists of 77% water while an adult's consists of approximately 
        70%. The percentage gradually decreases throughout life with the elderly's 
        body consisting of only 50% water. </p>

        necessary for virtually every chemical reaction required to keep us alive 
        and healthy.</font> We can live for weeks without food but only a few 
        days without water. Water is needed to carry oxygen and nutrients to the 
        cells, to dissolve minerals, for lubricating the joints, moistening and 
        protecting body tissues and organs, and for flushing out waste products. 
        When we don't get enough water a condition known as <b>dehydration</b> 
        occurs. The symptoms of dehydration include thirst, less frequent urination, 
        dark colored urine, dry skin, fatigue and lightheadedness. The symptoms 
        of dehydration in children include dry mouth and tongue, no tears when 
        crying, no wet diapers for 3 hours or more, sunken abdomen, eyes or cheeks, 
        high fever, listlessness, irritability and skin that does not flatten 
        when pinched and released. <br>

      <p><font size="+1">Today, with growing populations and increasing pollution 
        of our natural resources, we are facing a water crisis.</font> The World 
        Health Organization estimates that over one billion people lack safe drinking 
        water, and water borne diseases are responsible for the deaths of 4,000 
        children every day! </p>
      <p><font size="+1">It is estimated that the average American uses about 
        50 gallons (190 l) of water per day.</font> This includes not only water 
        for food preparation and drinking, but all other uses as well, including 
        showering, flushing the toilet, etc. During an emergency, when our municipal 
        water is cut off, we are obviously going to have to make do with much 
        less!</p>
      <p><font size="+1">The medical profession tells us that we should drink 
        8 glasses of water a day.</font> The US National Research Council recommends 
        a total of 2.7 liters (about 3 quarts) of water (including food sources) 
        for women and 3.7 liters (about a gallon) for men. The actual amount of 
        water we need will vary depending on temperature, humidity and activity 
        level. In hot climates and when the level of activity is high, the human 
        body may require up to two gallons (8 l) of water per day to avoid dehydration.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Survivalists usually agree that when computing your water 
        needs during an emergency you should plan on one gallon (4 l) of water 
        per person per day. </font>This allows for drinking, food preparation 
        and minimal washing (such as sponging off.) During hot weather and especially 
        when the activity level is high this amount should be doubled.</p>

      <p>A water dispenser like the one pictured above, along with a few extra 
        bottles of purified water, will provide emergency water for drinking and 
        food preparation during a short-term emergency. We keep this unit in our 
        kitchen for our everyday drinking water needs, refilling it with a <a target="blank" href="http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/product/natures-spring-ro-water-unit/1935/?upline=192734">Nature's

      <p>When your municipal water fails, one of the easiest places to get a small 
        amount of emergency water is from the water still remaining in the pipes 
        in your house. First shut off the main water valve into your house to 
        prevent the water from flowing back into the water main. Then open a tap 
        at the highest location in your house, to allow air to flow into the pipes, 
        and collect water from a tap at the lowest location in your house. You 
        may also be able to use the water stored in your water heater by collecting 
        it from the drain tap located near the bottom of the unit.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Since water is so vitally important, and because so much 
        of it is needed for survival, we should prepare for a disaster by storing 
        as much as we practically can, and by making preparations for collecting

      <p><font size="+1">Polluted water is extremely dangerous. It has been estimated 
        that worldwide, water borne diseases are responsible for about half of 
        all hospitalizations.</font> Bacteria in our drinking water is the cause 
        of many deadly diseases, such as cholera, amebic dysentery and life-threatening 
        diarrhea. Even in the best of times the water in our rivers, streams and 
        lakes is unsafe for drinking. Imagine how much worse it will become when 
        our sewage treatment systems are not working properly. There is no doubt 
        that more human waste&#151;the primary source of dangerous disease-causing 
        bacteria&#151;will enter our water supply after a disaster strikes. Even 
        water collected from rain and snow, due to pollution in the air, must 
        be treated before it is consumed. Survivalists tell us that rainwater 
        should be treated pretty much the same as pond or river water.</p>

        Water</font></h3>
      <p><font size="+1">Even the purist water will go bad due to bacterial growth 
        when stored over an extended period of time.</font> Whenever water is 
        stored for an emergency it should be rotated and replaced regularly. The 
        old water should be used (I use it to water my garden when rain is scarce) 
        and the storage containers should be washed and rinsed and replaced with 
        fresh water each year. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">The shelf-life of stored water can be extended by adding 
        a small amount of household <b>chlorine bleach</b> (e.g., Clorox) or </font><b>Calcium 
        Hypochlorite</b> solution (see below.) To prepare water for storage add 
        4 drops of chlorine bleach per gallon of water (1 drop per liter). For 
        larger vessels add one teaspoon of chlorine bleach per 30 gallons (4 cc 
        per 100 liters). Don't worry about being exact with your measurements. 
        Avoid buying chlorine bleach with scents or other additives. Use only 
        plain old-fashioned chlorine bleach or calcium hypochlorite (swimming 
        pool &quot;Shock&quot;.)</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\waterstorage2.jpg"><img src="img\waterstorage2.jpg" width="512" height="342" border="0"></a></p>
      <p>Water can be stored in many different types of containers, from small 
        plastic bottles to 55 gallon (200 l) drums. Old milk containers are not 
        recommended because they can never be cleaned thoroughly enough to prevent 
        spoilage from bacteria. Five gallon plastic containers are great. They 
        will also come in handy if you need to transport water. Fifty-five gallon 
        (200 l) plastic drums are ideal if you have room to store them. These 
        can be quite expensive if purchased new, but there are always used drums 
        available if you search for them. I have purchased used drums for as low 
        as $10 each from retail outlets, and for as little as a few dollars each 
        at estate sales. Be sure that your drums have not been used to store toxic 
        materials. All plastics are slightly porous and it is impossible to completely 
        remove the toxins from the plastic. Beverage bottling companies usually 
        receive their ingredients in food-grade plastic drums that are perfectly 
        suitable for water storage. If you are unsure about what was originally 
        stored in your plastic drum, then use that drum for non-potable water 
        only. Non-potable water will come in very handy for washing and for flushing 
        your toilet. I suggest that you use a large permanent marker to mark your 
        water storage containers as either &quot;Potable&quot; or &quot;Non-Potable.&quot;</p>

        you can acquire clean fresh water. In fact, if you do not have one you 
        might even consider having one dug on your property just for prolonged 
        emergencies.</font> If you have a well make sure that you have some way 
        of pumping the water out when you are without electricity. An old-fashioned 
        hand operated pump is ideal for emergencies. Perhaps you have a neighbor 
        who has a well and can work out some arrangement with him or her.<br>

      <h4>Rainwater<br>
      </h4>
      <p><font size="+1">Prepare for an emergency now by storing the equipment 
        that you will need to collect rainwater.</font> This will allow you to 
        supplement your stored water reserves during a prolonged emergency. For 
        example, a tarpaulin can be set up to collect rain and funnel it into 
        a pot or other collection vessel. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\rainbarrel2.jpg"><img src="img\rainbarrel2.jpg" width="342" height="513" border="0"></a> 
      </p>
      <p>My favorite way to collect rainwater is from the down spouts that drain 
        the rainwater from my roof. I divert this water into 55 gallon (200 l) 
        plastic drums, like the one pictured above, which is set up to collect 
        the rain that runs off the roof of my garage. Prior to the days of municipal 
        water, people commonly used barrels to collect water in this manner. I 
        have two plastic drums that I have set up to collect rainwater from my 
        roof. During the dry season, I periodically siphon this water through 
        a garden hose to my garden, thus saving considerably on my water bill 
        (and preventing the barrels from becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes.) 
        This setup comes in handy now, but during a prolonged emergency it could 
        prove to be a real lifesaver.</p>

        Here is a tip that I recently discovered while surfing the Internet: You 
        may be able to use satellite photographs taken from space to help you 
        locate the bodies of water near your home, even if they are on private 
        property that is not easily visible to you. Go to <a href="http://earth.google.com/">http://earth.google.com/</a> 
        and click on &quot;Download Google Earth&quot; to get the free software. 
        Once you have installed it on your computer you can virtually &quot;fly 
        to&quot; your home by simply entering your address for a bird's eye view 
        of your house and the surrounding area. You can then use the software 
        to zoom in or out and to move around the area surrounding your home to 
        search for bodies of water.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Below is a Google Earth satellite image of the street that I live on. 
        With this image I discovered four small bodies of water that I was previously 
        unaware of (which I have indicated in the photograph with red arrows) 
        . <br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\GoogleEarth_Image1.jpg"><img src="img\GoogleEarth_Image1.jpg" width="500" height="401" border="0"></a></p>
      <p>Below is another satellite image of my street a bit further south. The 
        red arrows which I have drawn on the image show two streams that cross 
        under the road that I travel on every day. During a dire emergency these 
        streams represent potential areas within walking distance of my home where 
        I may be able to collect water. I have printed out these two images and 
        stored them with my survival supplies&#151;just in case!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\GoogleEarth_Image2.jpg"><img src="img\GoogleEarth_Image2.jpg" width="500" height="401" border="0"></a> 
      </p>
      <p>The Google Earth satellite images of metropolitan areas are much more 
        detailed than those of rural areas. If you live in a rural area your images 
        might not be as detailed as the ones shown above. But in a rural area 
        you will probably be better able to find your local sources of water by 
        exploring your immediate surroundings on foot.</p>
      <p> I live in a suburb of a very large metropolitan area. The streams near 
        my home are very polluted, mostly from the runoff of fertilizers and weed 
        killers that my fellow suburbanites use to keep their lawns green and 
        immaculate (and our streams free of fish and frogs.) During a prolonged 
        emergency without municipal water and proper sewage disposal, these streams 
        are likely to be contaminated with sewage as well. Stored water and rainwater 
        would be much preferable, but if there is ever a critical shortage of 
        water, polluted water will certainly be better than no water. This brings 
        us to the next section, how to filter and purify the water that you collect.</p>

        Water</font></h3>
      <p><font size="+1">We will now consider the various ways that water can 
        be filtered and purified.</font> As we will see, some methods do not lend 
        themselves well to emergencies. The method you will use will depend on 
        the equipment you have available and how dirty your water is.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There are three basic ways to purify water: <br>
        1. Mechanical filtration<br>
        2. Heat<br>
        3. Chemical treatment<br>
        For some situations you may choose to use a combination of these.<br>
      </p>
      <p> 
      <h4 align="left">Mechanical Filtration<br>
      </h4>
      <p><font size="+1">During a prolonged emergency, many of us will be collecting 
        a lot of brown and green water. The first step in treating this water 
        is to let it sit undisturbed for up to 24 hours, allowing the dirt and 
        algae to settle to the bottom leaving relatively clear water on top. Then 
        carefully pour or siphon the clear water off leaving the sediment behind</font>. 
        The water containing the sediment can be used for watering your plants 
        or even for flushing your toilet. Allowing the water to settle in this 
        way will provide a lot less wear and tear on your filtration systems, 
        which in turn will last longer and require less maintenance.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mechanical filtration involves running your water through some type of 
        filter medium to entrap particulate matter. There are various ways to 
        do this, using both homemade and store-bought devices. One way is to pour 
        the water through sand. You can construct a wooden box, open at both the 
        top and the bottom. Place the box on top of a tarpaulin on a slight incline 
        and fill it with sand. Pour your untreated water in the sand and collect 
        it in a bucket at the bottom of the incline. You can also make a sand 
        filter using a 5 or 6 gallon plastic bucket. Punch small holes in the 
        bottom of the bucket and place a few layers of cloth in the bottom to 
        keep the sand in. Then fill the bucket with sand. Pour the water slowly 
        into the bucket and collect it as it drips from the holes in the bottom. 
        When your sand become nasty you can spread it out in the sun and let the 
        sun's ultraviolet rays purify it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There are various mechanical water filters that you can purchase that 
        will work very nicely. In general, the charcoal filters that you normally 
        use on your tap are not adequate for water contaminated by microbes or 
        germs. However, they work very well to remove the chlorine or iodine odor 
        and taste after you have chemically treated your water using one of the 
        chemical methods listed below.<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Ceramic filters are designed for field use by backpackers 
        and outdoor enthusiasts and are excellent for emergencies.</font> They 
        usually make use of a hand pump that forces the water under pressure through 
        a ceramic element. The ceramic is slightly porous allowing water to pass 
        through while blocking very tiny particulate matter, even most microorganisms. 
        If you suspect that your water is heavily contaminated with microbes you 
        should treat it first chemically (see below) before passing it through 
        the ceramic filter. Ceramic filters work very well and last a long time. 
        You can clean them and use them over and over. I highly recommend that 
        all survival-minded people acquire a good quality ceramic filter. One 
        popular type is illustrated in the photograph below:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\msrwaterfilter.jpg"><img src="img\msrwaterfilter.jpg" width="512" height="341" border="0"></a></p>
      <p>The photograph above shows an <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thenewsurvivalist-20/102-1878054-3132968?_encoding=UTF8&node=13">MSR 
        ceramic filter</a> attached to a four liter dromedary bag. This is a popular 
        setup with back packers. The threads on the bottom of MSR filters will 
        also fit onto Nalgene bottles like the yellow one pictured here.</p>
      <p> 
      <h4 align="left">Heat<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Whenever the municipal water supply has been contaminated with bacteria, 
        local authorities will issue a boil order. They usually recommend that 
        you bring your water to a rolling boil for at least five minutes before 
        using it for drinking or cooking. This is clearly overkill. They are assuming 
        that there is plenty of energy for heating the water and they would rather 
        people err on the side of overkill since they know that many people will 
        not fully comply with their recommendations anyway. In an emergency, energy 
        is likely to be scarce, so you will want to conserve it as much as possible. 
        Contaminated water can be adequately treated with heat without bringing 
        it to a boil by using the following water pasteurization process.<br>
      </p>
      <p> 
      <h4 align="left">Water Pasteurization<br>
      </h4>
      <p><font size="+1">All that is necessary to kill all the germs, viruses 
        and parasites in contaminated water is to bring the water to a temperature 
        of 150 degrees F (65 C) and keep it there for at least 6 minutes.</font> 
        Less time is required if you heat the water to a higher temperature. If 
        energy is in critical supply, water pasteurization can be easily accomplished 
        using a homemade solar heating device or a solar oven. A very simple solar 
        water pasteurization device can be made using an empty two liter plastic 
        soft drink bottle and an aluminum soda can. Paint the outside of the aluminum 
        can black using nontoxic paint. Cut the two liter plastic soft drink bottle 
        in half so you can put the aluminum can inside it. Put water in the aluminum 
        can, put the aluminum can inside the plastic bottle, and put the entire 
        unit in the direct sun. <br>
      </p>
      <p>You can also pasteurize water using any solar cooker. For more ideas 
        on solar pasteurization see the following web page: <a href="http://www.solarcooking.org/pasteurization/">http://www.solarcooking.org/pasteurization/</a><br>
      </p>
      <p> 
      <h4>Chemical Treatments <br>
      </h4>
      <p><font size="+1">After your stored water supply is depleted, your best 
        source for water will likely be precipitation, either rainwater or snow. 
        </font>This water is relatively clean, when compared to pond water, but 
        it still has to be treated before it is consumed. Untreated rainwater 
        will do nicely for washing and bathing. But for drinking and cooking it 
        will need to be run through a water filter or treated with a little chlorine 
        bleach or tincture of iodine. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Common household chlorine bleach</b> (e.g., Clorox) can be effectively 
        used for water purification. Add 3 drops of chlorine bleach per quart 
        (liter) of water and agitate. Double the amount of bleach if the water 
        is turbid. Let the water stand for 30 minutes and then smell it. There 
        should be a slight odor of chlorine. If there is no chlorine odor repeat 
        the process and let the water stand for another 30 minutes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>An alternative to chlorine bleach is <b>2% tincture of iodine</b> (the 
        iodine used for treating minor wounds.) Use 5 drops of iodine tincture 
        per quart of water and let it stand for 30 minutes.<br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Both chlorine bleach and tincture of iodine are essential 
        items to store in your emergency supplies.</font> The tincture of iodine 
        will double as part of your first aid equipment. Be aware that both have 
        fairly short shelf-lives&#151;about two years. If your chlorine bleach 
        is over one year old you may have to double the amounts recommended. As 
        with all of your emergency supplies you should rotate your stock using 
        the old and replacing it periodically with new stock. A great alternative 
        to chlorine bleach, which doesn't have the shelf-life problem, is calcium 
        hypochlorite:</p>
      <p><b>Calcium Hypochlorite, </b> also known as as &quot;Pool Shock,&quot; 
        is a great chemical treatment for water. It is available from swimming 
        pool and hot tub supply stores in granular powder or tablet form. In this 
        dry form it has a very long shelf-life, unlike liquid chlorine bleach 
        or tincture of iodine. A one pound bag of calcium hypochlorite in granular 
        form will treat up to 10,000 gallons of water and as of this writing costs 
        less than $4. To make a chlorine solution for disinfecting water dissolve 
        one heaping teaspoon (about one quarter ounce) of 73-78% granular calcium 
        hypochlorite into two gallons (8 l) of water. <font color="#FF0000">(Do 
        not drink this solution! Label it as poison.)</font> To disinfect water 
        for drinking, add one part of this chlorine solution to 100 parts water. 
        Stir well and let the mixture sit for at least a half hour before drinking. 
        As with chlorine bleach or tincture of iodine, the taste can be improved 
        by pouring your chemically treated water through activated carbon before 
        drinking. Once mixed with water the shelf-life of calcium hypochlorite 
        is similar to that of liquid chlorine bleach, so the solution should not 
        be prepared until it is time to use it for treating your water.<br>
      </p>
      <p> 
      <h4>Other Methods of Water Purification<br>
      </h4>
      <p>A few other methods for water purification are mentioned below. Some 
        of these, for reasons that will become clear, will probably not be suitable 
        for emergency situations but I mentioned them for the sake of completeness. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Water Distillation</b> involves boiling water in an enclosed container 
        and then trapping the steam that comes off and condensing it back into 
        water which is collected in another container. Any contaminants in the 
        water are left behind in the boiling water or destroyed by the heat. Distillation 
        produces very pure water. However, as you can imagine, distillation consumes 
        a tremendous amount of energy and is therefore expensive and inefficient.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\waterdistiller.jpg"><img src="img\waterdistiller.jpg" width="512" height="411" border="0"></a></p>
      <p>Pictured above is a &quot;Midi Still&quot; home water distillation unit. 
        It is useful for making your own distilled water but is not suitable for 
        emergencies because it requires a lot of electricity. Due to high energy 
        consumption, water distillation is also not the best way to purify your 
        water even during normal times. Reverse Osmosis (described later) is a 
        much better way for making your tap water safe for drinking. </p>
      <p><b>Condensation</b> is related to water distillation and may be a useful 
        technique for obtaining small amounts of purified water during emergencies. 
        A &quot;solar still&quot; can be made by digging a hole in the ground 
        in a sunny location. The hole should be about three feet (1 m) wide or 
        larger and shaped like an inverted cone or funnel with the deepest part 
        in the center. A collection container, such as a can or pot, is placed 
        in the center of the hole. Clear plastic sheeting is then placed over 
        the hole covering it completely and rocks are used to hold down the edges. 
        Another small rock is placed in the center of the plastic sheet, just 
        above the collection container, so that the plastic sheeting forms an 
        inverted cone. The sun causes evaporation of water from the ground, which 
        condenses on the inside of the plastic sheeting and runs down the plastic 
        to drip into the collection container.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Reverse Osmosis (RO)</b> uses high pressure, such as the water pressure 
        normally found in your tap, to force water through a semipermeable membrane. 
        As with the ceramic filters mentioned above, the semipermeable membrane 
        allows water molecules to pass through but traps particulate matter, even 
        very tiny microbes. Countertop reverse osmosis filters are not very practical 
        during emergencies because they rely on the high pressure that is normally 
        found in our municipal water pipes to force water through the membrane. 
        These units are, however, very efficient during normal times when the 
        water pressure in your tap is normal, and I recommend them as a means 
        for making your tap water safe for drinking. Gas molecules, like chlorine, 
        are smaller than water molecules and are not trapped by the membrane. 
        Reverse osmosis filters are therefore usually multistage filters with 
        one or more stages consisting of activated carbon (or &quot;charcoal&quot;) 
        to remove the gases. Reverse osmosis membranes do remove fluoride. Below 
        is a picture of a countertop reverse osmosis filter. This is the type 
        of filter I recommend for use during normal times. I use the Nature's 
        Spring RO filter available from <a target="blank" href="http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/product/natures-spring-ro-water-unit/1935/?upline=192734"> 
        Nature's Sunshine Products</a>:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\reverseosmosis.jpg"><img src="img\reverseosmosis.jpg" width="512" height="342" border="0"></a><br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Charcoal Filters</b> use activated carbon to purify water. Most inexpensive 
        countertop water filters use activated carbon. These are good for removing 
        chlorine, fluorine and some toxins to make tap water safer and better 
        tasting, similar to good quality bottled water. However, they do not remove 
        heavy metals like mercury or lead and they do not remove bacteria. For 
        home use, during normal times, I prefer a quality reverse osmosis unit 
        which includes an activated carbon stage, like the one mentioned and illustrated 
        above. During emergencies, when you are using a chemical means such as 
        chlorine bleach, calcium hypochlorite (swimming pool &quot;Shock&quot;), 
        or iodine to purify your water, it would be nice, but not necessary, to 
        be able to pass your water through activated carbon to remove the unpleasant 
        chlorine or iodine taste.</p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Silver</font></b><font size="+1">, due to its excellent 
        antibacterial properties, is also used in some types of very efficient 
        water purification systems, usually in conjunction with other filtration 
        media such as activated carbon and a particulate entrapment medium of 
        some kind.</font> The silver contained in these filters kills the microbes 
        while the activated carbon neutralizes and removes toxins. Due to its 
        efficiency, durability and reliability, a good quality silver filtration 
        unit can be an excellent asset during an emergency. </p>

        other (in the foreground) is ready for travel or storage. In the center

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_7"> Conserving Water</h3>
      <p><font size="+1">As we saw earlier, due to overpopulation and pollution, 
        clean fresh water is a diminishing resource worldwide.</font> The U.S. 
        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that runoff from driveways, 
        streets and yards is the single biggest threat to the health of American 
        waterways. According to the EPA, Americans apply 67 million pounds of 
        pesticides to their lawns every year. Agricultural run-off of fertilizers 
        and pesticides has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where the 
        Mississippi River enters and for miles out into the Gulf. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Even during normal times water should be conserved as 
        much as possible, and efforts should be made to minimize the pollution 
        of our streams, lakes and oceans.</font> In the future, hopefully more 
        organic methods will be employed for growing crops and the use of chemicals 
        can be reduced. Homeowners can reduce pollution of our fresh water by 
        refraining from using chemical fertilizers and weed killers on their lawns. 
        Ironically, two of the weeds that people find most troublesome&#151;dandelions 
        and plantains&#151;are also edible plants that can serve as excellent 
        survival foods (more on these &quot;weeds&quot; later.)</p>
      <p> <font size="+1">During times of emergency, when the municipal water 
        has ceased to flow, even more attention will need to be given to water 
        conservation. Toilet flushing, for example, will have to be kept to a 
        minimum. Excessively long and frequent showers will have to be eliminated. 
        We will also have to learn how to reuse water as much as possible.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">If our sewer systems are backed up, care must be taken 
        to insure the proper disposal of human and animal wastes. We must endeavor 
        not to pollute our streams and lakes, which will no doubt be serving as 
        someone's&#151;perhaps our own&#151;source of fresh water.</font> Human 
        waste is a very dangerous contaminant of water resulting in many deadly 
        waterborne diseases including life-threatening diarrhea. We will discuss 
        proper waste disposal, including disposal of human waste, in a later chapter 
        of this web site.<br>
      </p>
      <p> 
      <h4 align="left">Reuse of Gray Water<br>
      </h4>
      <p><font size="+1">Gray water refers to water that has been used once, but 
        remains potentially usable for something else</font>. You may have noticed 
        that the water that you have just used to bathe in or to wash your dishes 
        or clothes is tinged a dingy gray color. This is due mostly to the soap 
        that remains in the water. Rather than simply discarding this water, it 
        can be used to flush toilets or to water your plants or irrigate your 
        garden. The soap in the water is harmless to plants. So before you pour 
        your gray water down the drain, think about the ways you may be able to 
        reuse it&#151;just one more time! </p>
      <p>Develop these kinds of commonsense conservation habits during normal 
        times and they will be a cinch during times of emergency. Today, they 
        will allow you to protect the earth and save money. In the future they 
        may allow you to live more comfortably and perhaps even save a life.</p>

        Planner to the page where, in Action Steps 1 and 2, you made a list of

        that each emergency is likely to involve. Consider now the longest duration 
        that you considered likely for the events that cause you the most concern. 
        Is it one week? One month? Six months? </p>
      <p>Now consider the number of people in your family and figure on needing 
        at least one gallon (4 l) of water per person per day. Do you have other 
        family members who might move in during an emergency or a neighbor who 
        you might want to help? (Your neighbors will probably not be as prepared,

        that you should be able to replenish some of your water supply by collecting 
        precipitation (rain or snow) or by scrounging from a lake or stream. But 
        to do that you must have the necessary supplies, including purification 
        and filtration equipment.</p>
      <p>If you will be able to collect additional water to help replenish your 
        stored water, you might be wondering how much water you will actually 
        need to store. I recommend that you store at least a 30 day supply. So 
        multiply the number of people by 30 and that will give you the minimum 
        number of gallons that you will need to put into storage. Write that number 
        in your Action Planner along with the words &quot;minimum storage.&quot; 
        Remember that one gallon per person per day is the absolute minimum, not 
        allowing for washing. Additional water could turn out to be greatly appreciated 
        by everyone! If practical you should store two gallons per person per 
        day.</p>
      <p><font size="+2" color="#0000CC">B. Water Checklists: </font>In Action 
        Step 6 you created a &quot;Get&quot; list and a &quot;Do&quot; list for 
        water. Turn to that page now. In the &quot;Get&quot; column begin making 
        a list of the items that you would like to acquire to meet your water 
        needs, including collection materials, water treatment chemicals, water 
        filters, etc. Continue on the back side of the page if necessary. In the 
        right column under &quot;Do&quot; begin making a list of the things that 
        you would like to do, or accomplish, to help you meet your goal for water 
        storage. This list might include things like: Locate water sources around 
        my home, Ask neighbors about local wells, Build a system to collect rainwater, 
        etc. When you acquire an item or accomplish a task check it off your list. 
        As you think of additional items add them to your lists. You do not have 
        to run out and buy everything that you need right now. But start somewhere, 
        even if it is only with one five gallon storage container. You can add 
        to your stock as you are able, until you have reached your goal. Even 
        though you do not have everything that you need right now, you will have 
        made a start, and you will have a plan. It will only be a matter of time 
        before you will reach your goals.</p>
      <p>Below is a sample &quot;GET&quot; list of items that you may want to 
        acquire and a sample &quot;DO&quot; list of things that you might want 
        to accomplish to help you prepare for your water needs during an emergency. 
        Use these lists to help you formulate your own check lists:</p>
