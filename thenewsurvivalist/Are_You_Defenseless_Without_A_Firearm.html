  <tr> 
    <td valign="top" bordercolor="#CC3300"> <font size="+1">Probably every person 
      who has a carry permit in the United States has at least one other weapon 
      on them other than their pistol; I would be willing to bet it is a folding 
      knife.</font> I would also bet that they have never practiced with their 
      folding knives and practice with their carry pistol extensively. In this 
      article I will go over what I believe to be some rather important facts 
      as to why you should also train with your knife that you carry as much as 
      you train with your pistol. First of all, I have read on countless forums 
      the argument that concealed carry is a lifestyle and the hardcore carriers 
      make habits of avoiding places that forbid civilians from carrying pistols 
      onto the premisses. This simply isn't possible. Here are just a few of the 
      places under federal and state laws where civilians cannot, under any circumstances, 
      carry a firearm: 1. Commercial airline travel 2. Work (Most employers will 
      not let their employees carry guns to work) 3. Government establishments 
      such as the DMV, courtrooms (Jury duty) and the post office 4. Colleges 
      and any sports games on campus 5. High schools and any sports games on campus 
      You see, the horrible thing about these laws is they make these places a 
      virtual turkey shoot to anybody who desires to go on a shooting spree. And 
      the truth is, civilians who take the carry permit class and fill out the 
      paper work pretend that they are now special and can somehow avoid places 
      were no civilian, one-day class taken or not, can step inside with a firearm. 
      These places are impossible to avoid for any member of our society. It is 
      a fact that any normal person of average health can travel about 7 yards 
      in 2 seconds with a contact weapon such as a knife. It takes a person who 
      trains with his pistol about 1.5 seconds to take the gun from the holster 
      aim and get off a shot or two on average. So unless you're very aware of 
      your surroundings and the person's attack cues, you are getting stabbed. 
      And even if you did get a shot off you're probably still getting stabbed. 
      I'm not telling anyone to bring a knife to a gun fight, I'm just saying 
      I do not underestimate what a person is capable of with a knife. Especially 
      when they have trained with it. And here are some facts for the female audience 
      or those of you who have daughters. Women who are ages 16-19 statistically 
      are more likely to be the victims of violent crime than anyone else in this 
      country, with women ages 20-24 coming in second. Half of all the rapes in 
      the U.S happen to women under the age of 18. One third of rapes in the U.S 
      happen to women ages 12-17. To get a carry permit you have to be 21. So 
      by the time women are legally able to carry a pistol in public they have 
      passed the prime age for being attacked, raped, abducted or murdered. And 
      there are also the many fine politicians who represent us in Washington 
      D.C. who are dedicated to the disarmament of the American public. 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Senator- Dianne Feinsteine Democrat-California :</strong> 
          Interview with 60 minutes (1995) <em>“If I could have gotten 51 votes 
          in the senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up everyone 
          of them (Firearms), Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have 
          done it”.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Rep. William L. Clay (D-St. Louis, Mo.)</strong>, referenced 
          to the Brady Bill as <em>“The minimum step” that Congress should take 
          to control handguns. “We need much stricter gun control, and eventually 
          we should bar the ownership of handguns except in a few cases”</em></li>
      </ul>
      And the real horror story here is that for every shooting spree that takes 
      place in this country, it gives more fuel for these politicians to “Take 
      guns off the street”. And there is nothing John Q. Public can do from preventing 
      these tragedies from happening; they are simply a disgusting byproduct of 
      our morally bankrupt society. According to the latest official forecasts 
      by the IMF, the U.S. Economy will be surpassed by China's in real terms 
      by the year 2016. We are massively in debt to this communist superpower. 
      We also have become so financially dependent on them that China is beginning 
      to heavily influence our country's financial and economic policies. Don't 
      forget they forbid their citizens from even owning firearms. Think that 
      can't happen here? I beg to differ. Remember the mass gun confiscation in 
      Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina? I know the victims who had their guns 
      confiscated at that time still do. Here's a handful of them and their comments 
      on what happened that day. 
      <ul>
        <li>Robert Zas- <em>“Heed the warning of what this was, it's like Australia. 
          All the sudden, boom, they’ve got our rights.”</em></li>
        <li>Richard Styron- <em>“They took 'em, and  they didn’t have a right 
          to take 'em, they didn’t even have a reason to take 'em.”</em></li>
        <li>Buell Teel- <em>“Automatic rifles pointed at you, you don’t have any 
          choice... They didn’t care what your rights were, they were going to 
          deny them. It’s not America as we’ve known it before; it’s changing”</em></li>
        <li>Wayne Schum- <em>“We are living proof that all they have to do is 
          say, 'look- this is the law'.”</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>What do you think would happen if policemen banged on your door and had 
        M16's pointed at you and your family, one in the chamber, the safety off 
        and ready to go? You see, when the police come to your house and tell 
        you to give up your guns, the tough talk stops and you give them up, plain 
        and simple. I hope this never happens to anybody, but no gun owner in 
        this country should believe it's not a likely they will encounter a situation 
        similar to this in the near future. The <a href="http://www.fightingphilosophy.com/whats-your-fighting-philosophy/will-karate-work-in-a-street-fight/is-the-self-defense-system-as-lethal-as-it-claims/">best 
        self defense</a> training is combining baton and knife drills with your 
        firearms training. This won't solve all your problems, but it drastically 
        improves your <a href="http://www.fightingphilosophy.com/">self defense 
        training</a>. A good folding knife, baton, combat boots and a bulletproof 
        vest can go a long way if you keep a low profile. </p>
