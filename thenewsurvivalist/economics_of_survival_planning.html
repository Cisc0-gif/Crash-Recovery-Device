      <p><font size="+1">As you proceed through this web site you will read about 
        many items that you will want to buy&#151;extra food to put into storage, 
        extra clothing, storage containers, water filters, gardening equipment, 
        camping equipment&#151;the list may seem endless. Many of these items 
        can be quite expensive and you may be asking yourself how you are going 
        to afford all this stuff.</font></p>
      <p>I realize that this web site will be read by people from all walks of 
        life, from those who have plenty of money to those who are just barely 
        scraping by. This chapter is mostly for those with modest incomes.<font size="+1"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">First of all&#151;go slowly! You don't have to rush out 
        and buy everything right now. </font>If you will buy a small amount each 
        month, always within your budget, you will gradually accumulate everything 
        that you will need to be self-sufficient during an emergency. In the meantime, 
        every month you will be more prepared than you were the month before. 
        Even if you have not yet accumulated enough provisions for a six month 
        emergency, you will probably have enough to last for several days or weeks, 
        and you will be better off than most of your neighbors.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Focus on the most essential items first. Start by putting 
        together your bug out bags (BOBs.)</font> (You do not have to &quot;bug 
        out&quot; to use your BOB.) Get prepared for an emergency that will leave 
        you without utilities for three days. Then work up to being prepared for 
        a week-long emergency, then a two-week emergency, etc.&#151;until you 
        have reached your ultimate goal, whatever that might be. </p>

      <p>Perhaps you can find a few extra dollars each month by eliminating wasteful 
        spending, or by doing without some luxury items that you don't really 
        need. How much do you spend each week on movie rental fees, or on cable 
        or satellite channels? How many times a week does your family eat out? 
        Most people can easily find the extra money needed to accumulate survival 
        items simply by eating out less, and by spending their money more prudently 
        in other ways. </p>

        </font>This means paying off all your debts and establishing a regular 
        savings plan. I am a big advocate of budgeting. Budgeting allows you to 
        discover where your money is going and thereby gain control over it. Trying 
        to get ahead financially without a budget is like trying to fill a bucket 
        with holes in it. No matter how hard you work toward filling up your bucket 
        you will never succeed until you plug the holes. Plug the holes with a 
        budget and you will not only find the extra money needed for emergency 
        preparedness, but also the extra money that you will need to pay off your 
        debts and establish a savings plan. Do not buy anything on credit, except 
        for your house and perhaps your automobile. Use credit cards only for 
        emergencies and for convenience shopping (such as online shopping), and 
        then <u>only</u> if you can manage to pay them off each month. If you 
        can't pay them off each month then get rid of them! Even better; replace 
        your credit cards with debit cards, which provide the same convenience 
        but without going into debt! </p>

      <p><font size="+1">As I mentioned in the video at the top of this page, 
        I believe that canned goods should form the backbone of your survival 
        stash. That being said, it is imperative your canned goods are properly 
        labeled with <a href="http://www.labelcity.com/" target="_top">Dymo label 
        maker</a> to ensure no food spoils.</font><!-- 75-1yr-exJun1-16 --> The best canned foods are those 
        you can yourself. But as a supplement to that, you can always find some 
        canned foods on sale at the grocery store. If you will pick up a few extra 
        cans each time you buy groceries you will soon establish the foundation 
        of your survival stash. You can also save on many items by buying from 
        one of the warehouse distribution stores, or from a discount supermarket 
        chain such as Aldi (my favorite.) Unless you have a huge family I would 
        avoid buying canned goods in the large #10 cans (which hold about a gallon.) 
        Once opened, without refrigeration you may have a hard time consuming 
        the entire contents before it spoils. The smaller cans are much more practical 
        because they will usually provide just enough food for one meal with few 
        if any leftovers.</p>

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_4">Buy Previously Owned</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">You can save a lot of money on many survival items by 
        purchasing used items.</font> Water storage containers, water filters, 
        extra clothing, and camping equipment are just a few of the items that 
        you can often buy used. If you purchase a new 55-gallon plastic drum for 
        water storage it can cost you up to $100! But if you search around your 
        local community you can usually find used plastic barrels for as low as 
        $10 each. Thrift stores are an excellent place to look for bargains on 
        used supplies. I usually drop in on my local thrift store once a week 
        to see what &quot;new&quot; bargains they have in store for me.</p>

    <td bordercolor="#CC3300"> 
      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_5">Take Advantage of Estate Sales</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">Estate sales are by far my favorite supplier&#151;of 
        everything!</font> If you have ever enjoyed the bargains found at a garage 
        sale, you will really enjoy the bargains that you will find at estate 
        sales! In fact, I rarely even bother with garage sales any more, since 
        I can always find anywhere from 10 to 20 estate sales in my community 
        on any weekend, year round! At garages sale people usually offer only 
        a few items that they no longer need. I find that garage sales are often 
        not worth the gasoline used to drive to them. Estate sales, on the other 
        hand, are indoor sales in which everything in the house is tagged for 
        sale&#151;from the basement to the attic! And everything can be purchased 
        for pennies on the dollar, including clothing, tools, kitchen items, pantry 
        items and even furniture. The list is as endless as the items that people 
        keep in their homes. </p>
      <p>Look in the classifieds section of your local newspapers (including the 
        online versions) for a list of the estate sales in your community. Unlike 
        garage sales, which are seasonal, estate sales are held in every month 
        of the year. They are usually two-day sales held on a weekend. Most will 
        cut their already low tag prices in half on the last day of the sale. 
        We even buy most of our canned goods at estate sales, significantly reducing 
        our grocery bill. Canned meats that usually sell for $2 or more will generally 
        sell for 50 cents at an estate sale, and canned vegetables that cost 50 
        cents to $1 at grocery stores will sell for about 25 cents at an estate 
        sale. And the best part is&#151;You do not have to pay sales taxes on 
        the items that you purchase at estate sales! </p>
      <p>When purchasing foods at estate sales be sure to watch those &quot;best 
        by&quot; dates on the containers. I will frequently buy items that have 
        an expired date, but I am careful to use them first. The remaining shelf-life 
        will be less on these items so it is imperative that you carefully rotate 
        your stock. That is why it is important to buy only what you eat and to 
        eat what you buy. </p>
      <p>While on the subject of &quot;best by&quot; dates, keep the following 
        in mind: Unless the can is bulging or significantly damaged, canned foods 
        are still good long after this date. It is true that the quality, including 
        both the palatability and the nutritional value, begins to deteriorate 
        slightly after the &quot;best by&quot; date, and continues to gradually 
        decline the longer it is kept past that date. It is therefore desirable 
        that all foods are consumed by their &quot;best by&quot; date if possible, 
        and it is essential that your stored foods are rotated so that the older 
        items are consumed first. But don't be afraid to eat something just because 
        its &quot;best by&quot; date has expired. I have frequently eaten canned 
        goods five years&#151;and on occasion even up to 10 years&#151;past the 
        date, and have never experienced any ill effects from doing so. But never, 
        under any circumstances, eat&#151;nor even taste&#151;food taken from 
        a can that was swollen or bulging!</p>

        your family needs. (More on this in Chapter 15.) Some people grow fruits 
        and vegetables which they sell on the roadside. I have a neighbor who 
        is a part-time bee keeper who sells honey. Small engine repair and handyman 
        services are other potential sources of income. Many Americans work for 
        themselves during their spare time, accepting cash or barter as payment, 
        and in so doing make up a part of the huge &quot;underground economy&quot; 
        (which may or may not report their additional income to the government.) 
        Take an inventory of your skills, talents, and most importantly your interests,

        things like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Establish a written budget for household income and expenditures.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Have a garage sale to raise a few extra dollars.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Buy a few extra canned goods each time we buy groceries.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Regularly check our local thrift stores and secondhand shops 
          for the items on my lists.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Check our newspaper's classifieds section each week for 
          estate sales in our area.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Take an inventory of my skills, talents and interests and 
          consider starting a home-based business.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><font size="+2" color="#0000CC">B. </font>Turn your Action Planner to 
        a new blank page or use the back of the one you just used. At the top 
        of the page write &quot;Establish Priorities.&quot; Then on the left side 
        of the page make a list of the items that you and your family will be 
        willing to sacrifice in order to meet your goals. To the right of that 
        write down how much money this will save you each month&#151;extra money 
        that you will be able to use for your survival purchases. Try to find 
        areas where you are needless spending money. For example:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] We will eat out once a week instead of three or more times. 
          This will save us $80 a month.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] We will rent no more than three movies a week, instead of 
          our usual five. This will save us $32 a month.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] I will take bottled water (recycled bottles filled from 
          my own water filter) to work rather than buying drinks from the vending 
          machine. This will save us $25 a month.</li>
        <li>[&nbsp; ] Etc.</li>
      </ol>
