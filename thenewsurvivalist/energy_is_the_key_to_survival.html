      <font size="+2" color="#000066">In physics class we learned that energy 
      is the capacity to do work.</font><font size="+1"> We saw earlier that food 
      is the stored energy which makes life possible. Every human activity requires 
      energy. We need it to charge our phones and to heat our homes. From growing 
      our food to cooking it, energy is the key to survival. In this chapter we 
      will explore this important topic and look at sources of energy that we 
      might draw upon during an emergency.</font> 
      <p><font size="+1">Virtually all of the energy on Earth comes from the Sun. 
        </font>Plants absorb energy directly from sunlight and plant-eating animals 
        get it by consuming plants. Then carnivores eat plant-eating animals and 
        so goes the food chain right to the top where humans are found. The sun's 
        energy stored in trees is released when we burn wood. The energy stored 
        in plants and animals that died millions of years ago provides us today 
        with the coal, oil and natural gas that we depend on to run our economies. 
        Even the electricity we get from hydroelectric dams comes from the sun, 
        which evaporated the waters which produced the rain and snow which fed 
        the rivers and lakes. </p>
      <p>When humans discovered fire we were able to move from the warmer regions 
        of the earth to the colder areas. The discovery of fossil fuels&#151;first 
        coal, and then oil and natural gas&#151;led to the industrial revolution. 
        With inexpensive fertilizers produced from natural gas, and abundant cheap 
        gasoline and diesel fuel to power farming equipment, we were able to produce 
        food more efficiently and abundantly than ever before, and to transport 
        it in refrigerated trucks over great distances. <b>As a result of cheap 
        energy, today we expect to find fresh fruits and vegetables in our grocery 
        stores regardless of the season. We take this cornucopia of inexpensive 
        food for granted, but global warming, obesity and overpopulation have 
        now became concerns. </b></p>
      <p><font size="+1">But Nature is not without her own system of checks and 
        balances. </font>Geologists are warning us today about &quot;Peak Oil,&quot; 
        as fossil fuel production worldwide has begun to decline due to dwindling 
        resources. Unfortunately they just aren't making dinosaurs anymore, and 
        even if they were, we can't wait the millions of years that would be necessary 
        to churn them into new fossil fuels. Many scientists are predicting that 
        in the very near future our dwindling fossil fuel resources will become 
        critical, leading first to extraordinarily high energy prices, and eventually 
        maybe even to a tragic depopulation of the Earth. Some scientists say 
        that we have already approached this critical point, and the higher fuel 
        prices that we have witnessed over the past few years are just the beginnings 
        of the birth pangs, as compared to what we will experience in the not-too-distant 
        future. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Throughout the past century, the abundance of cheap energy 
        from fossil fuels has spoiled us, resulting in some unusual habits</font>. 
        We have become accustomed to wearing T-shirts and shorts in our homes 
        during the coldest months of the year, and long sleeves and woolen suits 
        in our air-conditioned offices during the hottest months. We have become 
        so used to this unnatural state that we now even design many of our new 
        office buildings with windows that can't even be opened!</p>
      <p>It is absurd that, even while our scientists are warning us about the 
        dangers of greenhouse gases, we Americans continue to buy the largest 
        gas-guzzling vehicles that we can get our hands on. The reprehensible 
        SUV has replaced the more sensible economy cars that appeared on the scene 
        after the energy crisis of the 1970's. But here is the bad news: Geologists 
        tell us that there is a huge difference between the approaching energy 
        crisis and the one of the 1970's. The energy crisis of the 1970's was 
        not caused by an actual shortage of oil, but rather by a politically motivated 
        embargo on the part of major oil producing nations. The energy crisis 
        that we are facing today is due to the actual depletion of the world's 
        easily-accessible (i.e., inexpensive) fossil fuel reserves. Make no mistake 
        about it, this situation is not going to improve. It will only get worse. 
        To the survivalist this is just one more reason why preparedness is more 
        important today than ever before!</p>

    <td bordercolor="#CC3300" colspan="2"><a name="generators"> 
      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_2">Generators</h2>
      </a> 
      <p>A generator can provide essential electric power during a short-term 
        emergency. There are two basic types: portable generators and standby 
        generators. 
      <p> A <b>portable generator</b> usually runs on gasoline. If nothing else 
        it may be able to provide enough power to keep your refrigerator and freezer 
        operating long enough for you to consume your cold food before it spoils. 
        The major disadvantage of a portable generator is that it operates on 
        gasoline, which does not store well. Gasoline should not be stored for 
        longer than a year because it deteriorates quickly leading to clogged 
        fuel lines or other mechanical problems. Gasoline is also highly volatile 
        and very dangerous to store.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you can afford the higher cost, a <b>standby generator</b> that will 
        run on either natural gas or propane can provide plenty of emergency power 
        for short-term emergencies. A standby generator can be hooked directly 
        into your home's existing natural gas line and will automatically provide 
        electricity during an electrical power outage. The system constantly monitors 
        utility power 24 hours a day. When power from the utility line fails an 
        automatic transfer switch safely disconnects the utility feed wires and 
        connects the generator feed. This eliminates the harmful back-feeding 
        of electricity from the house&#146;s generator power to the utility lines. 
        A signal is sent starting the generator and powering up your home. Automatic 
        generators continue to monitor utility power and reverse the switch when 
        the power outage ends, returning to standby mode. A propane dealer can 
        provide you with an underground propane tank that is protected from the 
        elements so that a constant source of fuel is available. According to 
        propane dealers, on average a 250 gallon propane tank fueling a seven 
        kilowatt standby generator will provide enough electricity to power a 
        home for five days. A 500 gallon underground tank will provide power on 
        average for 11 days. Of course, if you can conserve electricity by operating 
        only essential appliances when they are really needed (an air conditioner 
        is not an essential appliance) then your propane supply will last much 
        longer. Even if you have a natural gas line to your home, I recommend 
        that you go to the extra expense of having a propane tank installed, allowing 
        you to switch your generator from natural gas to propane if the natural 
        gas supply is interrupted. If you do not have a propane tank professionally 
        installed you should at least be quipped to switch your generator over 
        to a portable propane tank if the need should arise.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Many of us will not be able to afford a costly standby generator. And 
        even those who are fortunate enough to have one will perhaps want to make 
        plans for when their fuel runs out. What will we do then when the lights 
        go out and the gas ceases to flow? First consider what essential services 
        these utilities provide:</p>
      <div align="left"> 
        <ol>
          <li> Lighting</li>
          <li> Cooking</li>
          <li> Heating</li>
          <li> Communication</li>
          <li> Transportation </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <p>I will discuss communication and transportation in later chapters of 
        this web site. In the remainder of this chapter we will consider lighting, 
        cooking and heating.</p>
      <p>I purposefully left air-conditioning off this list because I do not consider 
        it essential. There are some who will disagree. My argument is that air 
        conditioning only became widely available a mere 50 or so years ago. Humans 
        have survived just fine for thousands if not millions of years without 
        it. Many people survive today in very hot climates without air-conditioning. 
        If you are in a building in which you don't believe you will survive without 
        air-conditioning, then I suggest you consider another location. When the 
        electricity goes out for a prolonged period of time, there will simply 
        be no air-conditioning, and there are few alternatives other than just 
        sweating it out the best way you can.</p>

      <p>One solution to the problem of lighting is to make the most of natural 
        light or sunlight. This means getting up and going to bed with the sun. 
        (As you can see, a large part of survival is simply common sense.) But 
        what about those times when you really need to see in the dark, particularly 
        during the months of the year in which the daylight period is shortened?

      <p>A solar charger can be used to recharge your rechargeable batteries during

      <p>A short-term solution for some of our lighting needs will be battery-operated 
        lights. Certainly a good flashlight with fresh batteries is an essential 
        emergency item for any home. You should also keep one in your car. You 
        might also consider buying rechargeable batteries, and perhaps even a 
        solar charger. I suggest that you keep a supply of both regular batteries 
        and rechargeable batteries in your survival stash. The newer nickel-metal 
        hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries are much better than the older nickel-cadmium 
        (NiCd) type. Rotate your regular batteries to keep them fresh and ready 
        for an emergency. You can store batteries in your refrigerator or freezer 
        to prolong their shelf-life. (I will further discuss batteries toward

      <p>LED flashlights are the most efficient type providing the most light 
        for the amount of energy used. The LED lights use very little electricity 
        so their batteries will last much longer. The wind-up type of LED flashlight 
        never needs batteries or a new bulb. It has a crank on the side that you 
        turn for about 60 seconds to charge up the permanent internal rechargeable 
        battery. This flashlight provides a low intensity light that lasts a surprisingly 
        long amount of time on each windup.</p>

      <p>Candles also provide inexpensive emergency lighting and every survival 
        stash should include a nice supply. Lit candles should be watched carefully, 
        especially when used around pets or children. Many houses have burned

        Don't forget to store plenty of matches as well!</p>

      <p>I frequently pick up candles at estate sales whenever I find them for 
        5 to 10 cents a piece. I have a huge box filled with candles in my survival 
        supplies which I purchased for pennies on the dollar. If I have more than 
        I can use during an emergency I can always use them for barter, since 
        candles will be a highly sought after commodity during any prolonged emergency 
        and few people store them these days.</p>

      <p>Kerosene lanterns are also a good option for providing light during a 
        power outage. These too are abundant at estate sales where they can be 
        picked up very economically. In addition to kerosene they will also burn 
        lantern oil, which comes in plastic bottles. Lantern oil is more refined 
        and burns cleaner but is much more expensive and some complain that it 
        does not wick as well as kerosene. I never buy lantern oil new but I have 
        picked up many bottles at estate sales for practically nothing and as 
        a result I have quite a stash. </p>

      <p>If you plan on using kerosene lanterns you will also want to store a 
        supply of kerosene, extra mantles or wicks, and extra globes in case yours 
        breaks. Kerosene will keep longer than gasoline, but I still recommend 
        that you try to rotate it out every few years or so. If you also have 
        a kerosene heater you can burn your kerosene during the cold months each 
        year so you can replace your supply with fresh stock. </p>

      <p>If you are well equipped for camping, you will also be well equipped 
        for any emergency. Hopefully you will have a good propane lantern as part 
        of your camping equipment. I consider propane lanterns to be a very good 
        choice. Propane is safe to store and it will keep for a very long time, 
        making it one of the best choices for stockpiling energy. Be sure to store

      <p>I also consider propane to be a good choice for your emergency cooking

        to fall back on during an emergency. Alcohol stoves, including the ones 
        that run on canned fuel or &quot;Sterno&quot; are nice alternatives, especially 
        if you live in a small apartment and don't have a lot of room to store 
        propane tanks. Outdoor barbecue grills can be use for cooking during emergencies, 
        but they are terribly inefficient when compared to camping stoves. Since 
        you will want to conserve your propane to make it last as long as possible, 
        I recommend that you avoid using a large outdoor grill, preferring a smaller 
        camping stove instead. <font color="#FF0000">(Warning: Never use a barbecue

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_D">Solar</h3>
      <p>Solar ovens are another excellent alternative for cooking your food. 
        Solar energy is free, and simple solar stoves are surprisingly easy and 
        inexpensive to make. Below are a few simple designs. There are excellent 
        online sources where you can get plans for building a solar oven, including 
        <a href="http://solarcooking.org/">http://solarcooking.org/</a>.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\solarbakingbread1.jpg"><img src="img\solarbakingbread1.jpg" width="512" height="341" border="0" alt="Baking bread with a solar oven"></a></p>
      <p>Perhaps the simplest and easiest design for a solar oven is the box type 
        pictured above. This homemade solar oven consists of a wooden box with 
        a double paned sliding glass top. The outside of the box is painted black 
        with nontoxic paint for maximum heat absorption. There are two different 
        opinions as to whether the inside should be painted black as well or coated 
        with a reflective material such as aluminum foil. Even though the oven 
        in the picture above has been painted black on the inside, I believe that 
        it is usually better for the inside to be reflective material. If the 
        box is black then the box will certainly heat up, but the idea is to heat 
        up the cooking container inside the box, and my experience has been that 
        a reflective material inside the box does a better job of that.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the design, most solar ovens require a reflector, such 
        as the one pictured above, to concentrate the light and heat from the 
        sun. The reflector above was made by simply covering a piece of cardboard 
        with aluminum foil. The aluminum foil is stuck to the cardboard using 
        a spray on adhesive. You can also use ordinary multipurpose glue, thinned 
        slightly with water so that it will spread on easily with a paint brush.</p>

      <p>These two 100% whole wheat French baguettes were cooked to perfection 
        in a baguette bread pan inside this simple solar oven in about three hours. 
        A more efficient solar oven will do the job in less than half the time. 
        The efficiency of a solar oven can be improved by insulating the box or 
        improving the reflector.</p>

      <p>Another creative design for a solar oven is the inner tube oven pictured 
        above. It consists of a large black inner tube sandwiched between two 
        panes of glass. The pan inside the oven should be black to maximize heat 
        absorption. The oven pictured above is sitting on a smooth blacktop surface 
        so the bottom pane of glass was omitted. It is important that the glass 
        fit smoothly against the inner tube all the way around to seal the inside 
        from heat loss. Even though this photograph does not show a reflector, 
        this type of oven will also require a reflector like the one pictured 
        with the box oven above.</p>

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_E">Cooking in a Solar Oven</h3>
      <p>Solar ovens generally do not get as hot as conventional ovens, so a longer 
        cooking time will often be required. For example, when I make whole wheat 
        bread in my kitchen oven I bake it for 30 minutes at 350<sup>o</sup> F 
        (177<sup>o</sup> C.) Baking a similar loaf in a simple box-type solar 
        oven can take up to three hours, depending on the efficiency of the solar 
        oven and the amount of sun. I have successfully baked bread at temperatures 
        as low as 155<sup>o</sup> to 175<sup>o</sup> F (68<sup>o</sup> to 80<sup>o</sup> 
        C.) On the plus side of solar ovens, it is nearly impossible to burn anything.</p>
      <p>If you cook meat in your solar oven I recommend that you use a meat thermometer. 
        You may never get your meat to the temperature recommended for conventional 
        cooking and so again a longer cooking time may be required. I recommend 
        that you strive for an internal temperature of at least 165<sup>o</sup> 
        F (74<sup>o</sup> C) as measured by a meat thermometer.</p>

      <h4 align="left">Food Safety When Solar Cooking</h4>
      <p>Regardless of the cooking method, the danger zone for cooked food is 
        between 50<sup>o</sup> and 125<sup>o</sup> F (10<sup>o</sup> and 52<sup>o</sup> 
        C.) It is recommended that cooked food be kept either above this zone 
        or below it. When cooked food has been in the danger zone for three to 
        four hours it should be discarded due to the possibility of food poisoning 
        by botulism or salmonella. Spoiled foods may contain dangerous toxins 
        without showing any noticeable signs of spoilage. Suspect foods should 
        not even be tasted since even a small amount of toxin can be very dangerous. 
        Reheating food that has been in the danger zone for too long will not 
        destroy the toxins nor render the food safe. </p>
      <p>When using a solar oven the danger occurs when the food is partially 
        cooked and then allowed to remain in the cooker too long after the oven 
        temperature falls into the danger zone. This is not usually a problem 
        because it is not difficult to keep the temperature above the danger zone. 
        The problem could occur if food remains in the oven for hours at the end 
        of the day or after the sun is obscured by clouds. If the food in your 
        solar oven is not done due to one of these conditions then another method 
        of cooking should be used to finish the job. For additional information 
        on solar cooking safety see <a href="http://solarcooking.org/foodsafety.htm">http://solarcooking.org/foodsafety.htm</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>As long as the above precautions are kept in mind, solar cooking lends 
        itself very well to absentee cooking. Raw, refrigerated or frozen foods, 
        even meat or chicken, may be placed in a solar oven while it is still 
        dark outside&#151;several hours before the sun begins the cooking process. 
        The food will remain cold enough to prevent spoilage and when the sun 
        rises the cooker will reach a safe level of heat quickly enough to prevent 
        it from being in the danger zone too long. Since it is difficult to overcook 
        or burn food in a solar oven, when the food is done it will simply stay 
        hot and above the danger zone until your return.</p>

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_F">Heating your Home During an Emergency</h2>
      </a> 
      <p>If you are already relying on stockpiled heating oil or propane for your 
        heating needs then you may already have a nice supply of stored energy 
        for an emergency. But your thermostat and furnace will not work when the 
        electricity is off. You could also experience this problem if you heat 
        your home using natural gas. You can look into ways of providing electricity 
        to your furnace when the power is off, but it would be even better to 
        install a natural gas space heater or a small furnace that does not require 
        electricity, for a backup during those times in which you lose electrical 
        power but still have gas or oil. If your oven uses natural gas you will 
        have to light it with a match since the electronic lighters will not work 
        when the electricity is off. </p>
      <p>Some people try to heat their homes when the electricity is off by operating 
        their natural gas ovens with the door open, but the gas company does not 
        recommend this procedure because it can be dangerous. Install a natural 
        gas space heater instead. However, when the electricity is off during 
        cold weather, that would be a good time to catch up on your baking if 
        you have natural gas, since a hot stove will provide supplemental heat 
        for your home. After your baking is done and the oven is turned off, leave 
        the oven door open for a while to let the escaping heat help keep you 
        warm. </p>
      <p>During an emergency your natural gas service could also become interrupted. 
        Alternative methods for heating your home include a kerosene heater, a 
        portable propane heater (like those used when camping in cold weather) 
        and a wood burning stove or fireplace. You will need to stockpile your 
        emergency energy source and conserve it so that it will last as long as 
        possible. You can save energy during an emergency by heating only a portion 
        of your home, closing off the rooms that are not needed. You can also 
        save a considerable amount of energy by not trying to keep your house 
        as warm as you have grown accustomed to during times of plentiful energy. 
        Wear plenty of warm clothing in your house, including a wool cap or similar 
        headgear, and you can be comfortable with inside temperatures as low as 
        60<sup>o</sup> F (16<sup>o</sup> C.) Remember that most heat loss from 
        the human body occurs from the head, so don't neglect the warm headgear!</p>

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_11">Kerosene</h3>
      <p>Many people choose a kerosene heater for their emergency heating needs. 
        Kerosene is certainly an option but it presents some disadvantages. Although 
        kerosene has a longer storage life than gasoline, like gasoline it will 
        deteriorate in time. One source that I checked recommended a one-year 
        shelf-life for kerosene. Another said that kerosene could be kept indefinitely 
        if stored in a tightly-closed container. I suspect that the truth lies 
        somewhere between these two extremes. I have stored kerosene for many 
        years without any problems. One thing is for sure and that is kerosene 
        should not be stored in your kerosene heater nor in your oil lamps. These 
        are not airtight and the kerosene will deteriorate and gum up the wick. 
        Manufacturers of kerosene heaters usually recommend that the wick be replaced 
        each year, and that is one reason why I do not like kerosene heaters. 
        (The wick will actually last for years, but it will work less efficiently 
        as carbon deposits build up on the burning end.) A kerosene additive is 
        available at most hardware stores that is purported to extend the storage 
        life of kerosene and make it burn cleaner. I recommend that you use this 
        additive if you plan on storing kerosene for long periods of time.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\kerosene.jpg"><img src="img\kerosene.jpg" width="512" height="342" border="0" alt="Kerosene heaters"></a></p>
      <p>If you use kerosene as your alternative fuel be sure to rotate your fuel 
        out of storage and replace your stock every few years. At the end of the 
        cold season completely empty your kerosene heater before putting it away 
        for summer storage.</p>

      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_12">Gasoline</h3>
      <p>Gasoline burning heaters and stoves are available but I don't recommend 
        them. Gasoline has a recommended storage life of only 6 months. Gasoline 
        is also very volatile and dangerous to store in large quantities. When 
        you use old gasoline there is a tendency for it to gum up the valves in 
        your stove or heater. Never store a gasoline appliance with fuel in it 
        or you will have problems for sure. </p>

      <p>Coleman makes a special fuel (shown on the left in the photograph above) 
        for their stoves which is highly refined and less likely to cause problems. 
        If you use a gasoline stove or heater you should use the recommended fuel. 
        But this fuel is expensive and it still has a relatively short shelf-life 
        when compared to other energy sources and I do not recommend it for long-term 
        storage. This photograph also shows a catalytic heater (right back) designed 
        to burn the same type of fuel and a two-burner stove (in the middle.) 
        In the foreground on the right is a black heat drum designed to convert 
        the one-burner stove (left foreground) into a heater.</p>

      </a> 
      <p>The electricity that comes into our homes from the electric company is 
        Alternating Current (AC.) AC has the advantage of being transferred with 
        low resistance over large distances through electrical wires or power 
        lines. Most of the appliances in our homes are designed to operate on 
        AC. The ones that don't either run on batteries or have a transformer 
        that converts AC into DC (Direct Current.) All batteries, like the ones 
        in your flashlight, cell phone and automobile, provide DC power. Solar 
        panels also produce DC power. </p>
      <p>In my video on Ham radios which appears in Chapter 11, I describe a simple 
        inexpensive 12-volt solar powered system that I use. Use <a href="http://youtu.be/1UtEsOw7Ekg?t=13m31s" target="blank">this

      <p>An Inverter is an electrical device that converts DC power to AC. You 
        can purchase small, portable inverters, like the one pictured above, to 
        convert 12 Volt DC power, such as that from your automobile, into AC power 
        that you can use to run AC appliances. The problem with inverters is that 
        they are inefficient because some of the DC power is converted into heat 
        rather than into AC power. They even contain an internal fan to help dissipate 
        the heat to prevent overheating. This means that a lot of your DC power 
        is wasted and as a result your battery will be drained quicker. For this 
        reason, if you use DC power, it is far better to use it to run DC appliances 
        rather than to convert it into AC power to run AC appliances.</p>

        (discharges of more than 50%.) If you want a battery for an emergency

      <p>Renewable Energy (RE) sources are used primarily to provide clean supplemental 
        energy to lower energy bills and help the environment. I mention them 
        here because they can also provide energy during an emergency and some 
        readers may be interested in pursuing this topic further. Their disadvantage 
        is their high cost. The wiring and installation of the generators is expensive, 
        and they require a bank of high-maintenance batteries to store the energy 
        and an expensive inverter to convert the direct current electricity they 
        produce into alternating current. If you are interested in using solar 
        energy to reduce your utility bills you might consider a solar water heater, 
        which may provide a greater return on your investment. Discussing RE in 
        detail is beyond the scope of this web site. Check the <a title="Additional Resources" href="survival_resources.html">Additional

      <p>An old satellite dish has some nice advantages. It was designed to be 
        adjustable, so it can be rotated and tilted to the most efficient position 
        for capturing the sun's rays. The first step in making a parabolic cooker 
        from a satellite dish is to mount the dish on a sturdy base that is heavy 
        enough to resist toppling over in the wind.</p>

      <p>After removing the LNB's from the LNB mount, I removed the dish from 
        the supporting pole and reinstalled it on the pole upside down. Turning 
        the dish upside down moved the LNB mount from the bottom to the top, where 
        it can be used for hanging the cooking pot. </p>

      <p>I found that a 1x2 inch board would fit perfectly into this type of LNB 
        mount. I made the arm adjustable by drilling holes in the board about 
        one inch apart, and using a nail to hold it at whatever position I desired. 
        I also put a hook in the end of the board to hang the cooking pot on.</p>

      <p>For the reflector I glued aluminum foil to the satellite dish. I used 
        ordinary white multipurpose glue, thinning it with a little water so I 
        could easily brush it on the dish.</p>

      <p>The dish should be positioned at a 90<sup>o</sup> angle to the sun's 
        rays. I replaced the angle adjustment nuts with wing nuts so they could 
        be loosened and tightened by hand. The angle remains the same throughout 
        the day. It changes only when the angle of the sun changes, according 
        to the season of the year. However, when in use the dish must be rotated 
        to follow the sun throughout the day, so I left the nuts which hold the 
        dish on the post loose so the dish could be freely rotated.</p>

      <p>For maximum absorption of heat and light, I painted the cooking pot solid 
        black using high temperature paint (the kind you use to paint barbecue 
        grills.)</p>

      <p> I'm sure we have all, at one time or another, used a magnifying glass 
        to focus the sun's rays to set a piece of paper on fire. A parabolic reflector 
        works in a similar way, as demonstrated in the photograph above. A newspaper 
        held at the focal point of this parabolic cooker took only 15 seconds 
        to ignite into flames. This experiment was conducted in September at 8:30 
        AM with the sun still low in the sky and an ambient temperature of only 
        65<sup>o</sup> F (18.3<sup>o</sup> C.)</p>

      <p>It is important to position the cooking pot at the precise focal point 
        of the parabolic cooker. Throughout the cooking process, the cooker will 
        need to be rotated slightly, about twice every hour, to follow the sun 
        as it travels across the sky. For this reason, a parabolic cooker does 
        not lend itself to absentee cooking as well as a box-type solar oven, 
        which can be left in the same position all day.</p>

      <p>A final and necessary step is to insulate the cooking pot to prevent 
        heat loss to the surrounding air. This greatly improves the efficiency 
        of the cooker and increases the temperature in the cooking pot. This can 
        be accomplished by placing the black pot inside a clear Pyrex glass dish, 
        or as illustrated above, by placing a clear plastic cooking bag around 
        the pot (the same kind of clear cooking bag that you use in your oven.)</p>

      <h4>A Final Warning about Parabolic Cookers: </h4>
      <p>A parabolic solar cooker produces an intense light and heat at its focal 
        point that can be very dangerous. I have even heard of one man who inadvertently 
        set his house on fire with a parabolic cooker that was not even in use. 
        Always wear sunglasses when working with any solar cooker outdoors. Just 
        as you would never look directly into the sun, be careful not to look 
        directly into the focal point of your parabolic cooker, where the sun's 
        rays are intensified many times. Never allow children to play with a solar 
        cooker&#151;particularly a parabolic solar cooker!</p>
