        a Disaster</font></h1>
      <p><font size="+1">Every survival and disaster preparedness book recommends 
        that you keep some cash in your stash. The reason is obvious; when the 
        electricity is off, credit card terminals, ATM machines and bank computers 
        will be out of commission. Even if stores are open, without electricity 
        they will not be able to accept your credit or debit cards. All transactions 
        will be cash only.</font></p>
      <p><font size="+1">Keeping a stash of cash for emergencies is good advice 
        and I recommend it too.</font> But your cash is only going to help if 
        the stores are open and stocked with goods, and if they have figured out 
        a way to conduct transactions without computerized cash registers. (Heaven 
        help us!) </p>
      <p>Perhaps your neighbor has some goods that you need and is willing to 
        accept your cash in exchange for them. But during a far-reaching and prolonged 
        emergency, a situation could arise in which your cash could be worthless. 
        After all, no matter how much money you have, you can't eat it! If the 
        stores are closed or their shelves are empty, it is also possible that 
        your neighbors will be unwilling to part with their supplies for your 
        money. After all, they can't eat it either. If their goods are essential 
        for their survival, and if they have no immediate use for your cash, then 
        they might not be willing to trade&#151;unless of course you have something 
        that they do need.</p>
      <p>This would be a time when it would be far better to have excess stocks 
        of essential goods rather than a lot of money, which after all is nothing 
        but paper. (Perhaps you will find a use for your paper money when you 
        run out of toilet paper.) Certain items in particular tend to be highly 
        sought after during times of emergency and may be particularly useful 
        for barter. These include batteries, matches, candles, fuel, ammunition, 
        etc. Anything of value can be used for barter. It all depends on your 
        neighbors' wants and needs. You can also barter your services. Perhaps 
        you are good at performing first aid or at processing a deer for example.</p>
      <p>While reading the next section of this chapter, the reader may initially 
        think that I have departed from the topic of this web site. Please bear 
        with me as I am confident that its relevance will become crystal clear 
        by the chapter's end. The topic of money is complex so a thorough understanding 
        of the basics is essential. I consider this to be one of the most important 
        chapters in this web site. I assure you that your time will be well spent, 
        for by the chapter's end, if I have been successful at setting the stage, 
        you will understand far better than most what I consider to be our most 
        imminent threat, and just as importantly, how you can successfully prepare 
        for it.</p>

        Perhaps I was particularly adept at gathering eggs, while your skills

        eggs three times a day was getting old, and you were becoming bored with 
        eating nothing but roots. Our problems were solved when we each discovered 
        that the other would be willing to part with some of his commodity in 
        exchange for some of the commodity of the other. With this first transaction 
        the seeds of civilization were planted, and just as importantly the free 
        market was born. </p>

        with for some of your roots? That will depend in part on how many eggs 
        I have (supply) and on how much I desire your roots (demand.) But it will 
        also depend on your supply of roots and on how much you want my eggs. 
        We will either come to a mutual agreement on the &quot;price,&quot; or 
        else we will part company in hopes of finding someone else to do business 
        with. If you find someone who will sell his or her eggs to you at a lower 
        price, I may discover that the demand for my eggs has fallen and will 
        have to adjust my price so that there is once again a demand for them.</p>

    <td bordercolor="#CC3300" colspan="2"> 
      <h3 class="level3" align="left" id="mbp_toc_4">The Birth of Money</h3>
      <p>Suppose in our primitive scenario you discover that your neighbor is 
        particularly skillful at making tools out of animal bones, and has made 
        a nice little shovel that you would like to have for digging up your root 
        vegetables. There is one problem though, your neighbor doesn't need any 
        of your vegetables. To your delight, however, you discover that she really 
        likes and needs eggs. You know that you can trade some of your vegetables 
        to me for eggs, and then trade the eggs to your neighbor for her shovel. 
        Now everyone is happy! </p>
      <p>But I am particularly delighted because I am discovering that there is 
        an increased demand for my eggs. It seems that everyone is demanding my 
        eggs. And since eggs are so universally coveted, people are using them 
        more and more as a medium of exchange, and the first money is born! </p>
      <p>I am not saying that eggs served as the first money. My story is to illustrate 
        that <b>money is a commodity</b> and that <b>any commodity can serve as 
        money</b>. But the most important point to learn from this story is that 
        <b>the free market determines what money is</b>. Any commodity that is 
        widely demanded can serve as money, and history has shown that many have. 
        Iron hoes have been used as money in both Asia and Africa. Beaver skins 
        and tobacco were both used as money by early American colonists. During 
        World War II American soldiers frequently used cigarettes as a medium 
        of exchange. Even soldiers who did not smoke would hoard and trade cigarettes, 
        because they knew that they could use them in exchange for goods and services 
        that they did want. Cigarettes are sometimes still used today in our penal 
        systems as a medium of exchange.</p>
      <p>Returning to our prehistoric story in which eggs are currently the preferred 
        medium of exchange: At first, everyone is happy. Eggs are small, light 
        weight, and are therefore easily carried from place to place. Thank goodness 
        oxen were not the medium of exchange! But soon everyone began to discover 
        that there were some problems with using eggs for money. First of all 
        they were not very durable. They would break easily. You tried storing 
        some under your mattress for a rainy day. But when that rainy day arrived 
        you discovered that your treasure was now a smelly mess! This teaches 
        us another important lesson about money: It should ideally hold its value 
        until you can spend it, even if you do not need to spend it right away. 
        <b>Money is not only a medium of exchange, it is also a store of value.</b> 
        Clearly a better commodity would have to be found.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Fortunately the free market did just that, and through 
        time people at various places throughout the Earth chose gold and silver 
        as the preferred medium of exchange and store of value. </font>These two 
        commodities presented many advantages: They were universally recognized 
        and desired, easily transported, homogenous (every ounce of the pure metal 
        was exactly the same as every other ounce), and they did not rust or rot. 
        You could bury your gold in your back yard and dig it up years later, 
        finding it essentially the same as when you buried it. In fact, gold and 
        silver that was buried thousands of years ago has been dug up in essentially 
        the same condition, and just as valuable, as when it was buried.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font color="#000066" size="+1">&quot;Gold was not selected arbitrarily 
          by governments to be the monetary standard. Gold had developed for many 
          centuries on the free market as the best money; as the commodity providing 
          the most stable and desirable monetary medium.&quot; &#151;Murray N.

Our oldest historical documents indicate that gold and silver have 
              been used as money for at least as far back as recorded history. 
              Silver and gold are mentioned in the book of Genesis:
            <blockquote> 
              <p><b><font size="+1" color="#000066">Abram had become very wealthy 
                in livestock and in silver and gold. &#151;Genesis 13:2 (NIV)</font></b></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The New Testament reveals that Jesus was betrayed for 30 pieces 
              of silver. The ancient Romans used silver coins, as did nearly every 
              civilization before and after them. The French word for silver, 
              <i>argent</i>, is also their word for money. The British pound was 
              once defined as one pound of Sterling. The Founding Fathers of the 
              United States of America declared the currency of the new nation 
              to be the dollar, which was defined as a certain weight of silver.

      <p>As convenient as gold and silver were, they still provided one disadvantage 
        as a currency. People who needed to carry a large amount found that their 
        pockets were weighted down with heavy coins. The solution was simple. 
        The banks or the government could keep some of the precious metals in 
        a vault or warehouse and issue warehouse receipts that could easily be 
        exchanged upon demand for the real thing. These warehouse receipts could 
        circulate in place of the real thing. Thus paper money was born. </p>
      <p>Some people were at first suspicious of paper money. But they soon learned 
        how easy it was to exchange the paper notes for the real thing. A trip 
        to any bank was all that was necessary to convert a paper dollar bill, 
        for example, into a real silver dollar&#151;a huge coin made of 90% silver 
        that contained almost three quarters of a troy ounce of pure silver. Of 
        course you could also ask for two half dollars, or four quarters, or ten 
        dimes, or any combination of these, all of which were made of 90% silver. 
        (Other countries used different compositions for their silver. In Canada, 
        for example, silver coinage consisted of 80% pure silver.) One U.S. dollar 
        face value, whether a silver dollar or a combination of halves, quarters 
        or dimes, contained the same amount of silver&#151;exactly one dollar's 
        worth! That was the time when the expression &quot;Sound as a dollar&quot; 
        appeared in the English language&#151;an expression which no one uses 
        today! </p>

      <p>The U.S. silver dollar was first minted in 1794. Previously the colonists 
        had used silver coins from other countries, particularly the Spanish Milled 
        Dollar or piece-of-eight, from which we acquired the term &quot;dollar.&quot; 
        In 1837 the weight of the U.S. dollar was established as 412.5 grains 
        and the fineness .900 (90% silver.) Silver is a soft metal and coins made 
        out of the pure metal wear too quickly in circulation, so the silver was 
        mixed with a small amount of copper for greater durability. The last two 
        types of silver dollars are illustrated in the photograph above, along 
        with a modern cent to show their relative sizes. The Morgan dollar, named 
        after the designer of the coin, was minted from 1878-1921. The &quot;Peace&quot; 
        dollar, so named because it contained the word &quot;peace&quot; on the 
        reverse, was minted from 1921-1935. These dollars each contained .77344 
        troy ounces of pure silver, slightly more than three quarters of a troy 
        ounce. (Any image on this web page may be left clicked for an enlargement.

        Two half dollars contain the same amount of silver as four quarters and

        by face value rather than coin type. (Because a tiny amount of silver

        of value, thus insuring a monopoly for the dollar, maintaining an artificial 
        demand for the currency as it was being transformed to a fiat currency 
        whose ties with real money were being progressively loosened. They simply

        the people would choose to store their wealth in real money rather than 
        in the paper which the government knew to be intrinsically worthless. 
        From this point onward the people could no longer redeem their dollars

      <h4 align="left">Debasement of Currency</h4>
      <p><font size="+1">Debasement is the practice of lowering the value of a 
        currency. Throughout the centuries many nations have debased their currencies. 
        Historians have noted that along with currency debasement there is a decline 
        in the civilization which eventually leads to its collapse.</font> The 
        decline and fall of the Roman Empire is a good example. Originally the 
        Roman denarius was almost pure silver, weighing about 4.5 grams. Over 
        time the value of the denarius was progressively decreased by the Roman 
        government, which would collect the silver coins, melt them down, and 
        then reissue more coins with the same face value but smaller in size and 
        lower in silver content. During the reign of the Claudio-Julian Emperors 
        the denarius contained approximately 4 grams of silver. Under Nero it 
        was reduced to 3.8 grams. The denarius continued to shrink in both size 
        and in purity, until by the second half of the third century it was only 
        about 2% silver. </p>
      <p>The reason Emperors debase their currencies is for their own financial 
        enrichment. Debasement allows them to create more coins out of the same 
        amount of precious metal, thus &quot;creating new money.&quot; The government 
        would collect the coins from the people, through confiscation or taxation, 
        and melt them down to create debased coins of the same face value but 
        lower silver content. The extra silver would be used to create &quot;new&quot; 
        money which the government would spend. But adding new coins into circulation 
        lowers the value of each coin, which we know as inflation. </p>
      <p>We have already learned that real money is a commodity, such as silver 
        or gold, and not simply a denomination for a commodity, such as a denarius 
        or a dollar. Since debasement creates no new silver, in reality no new 
        money is created&#151;only inflation. Debasement is therefore a method 
        for transferring wealth from one group to another. In this case, from 
        the citizens to the government. <b>Debasement or inflation is therefore 
        a hidden or covert tax.</b></p>

      <p><b>Debasement of the U.S. Dollar:</b> The two silver dollars on the left

        the same size as the silver dollars that preceded it, the Eisenhower dollars

        of a copper-nickel clad with no silver content. When the Susan B. Anthony 
        dollars were minted (1979-1999) even the size of the copper-nickel dollar 
        was reduced making it just slightly larger than a quarter. The Sacagawea 
        dollars (2000- ) were gold in color but contained neither gold nor silver. 
        It's gold color was achieved with a mixture of copper, zinc, manganese 
        and nickel. During this debasement of the U.S. dollar, the once commonly-heard 
        phrase &quot;Sound as a dollar&quot; disappeared from common usage. <b>The

        The Kennedy half dollar coin was first issued in 1964, which happened 
        to be the last year that U.S. silver coins were minted from 90% silver. 
        The 1964 is therefore the only regularly-issued Kennedy half dollar that 
        contains 90% silver. From 1965 to 1969 the half dollar was issued as a 
        clad coin with a core of pure copper and a front and back consisting of 
        80% silver and 20% copper, giving the coin a total composition of 40% 
        silver and a total silver content of .181 troy ounces (.36169 troy ounces 
        per $1 face value.) The half dollar was the only regularly issued U.S. 
        coin to be minted with any silver after 1964. Quarters, dimes and dollar 
        coins minted for circulation were minted from a combination of copper 
        and nickel. After 1970, no silver was used in the minting of the half 
        dollar as well and it became a clad coin composed only of copper and nickel 
        just like the others.</p>

      <h4 align="left">Counterfeiting the Dollar</h4>
      <p> <font size="+1">The U.S. dollar was originally defined as a specified 
        weight of silver.</font> The original weight was based on the Spanish 
        Milled Dollars, which were widely circulated among the colonists at the 
        time. Later the definition of the dollar would be expanded to include 
        its equivalent value in gold.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">As long as the U.S. dollar was soundly backed by gold 
        or silver, there was a limit on the amount of money that the government 
        could print, and there was a natural control over the money supply. The 
        government could not print more money than they could back with the gold 
        and silver held in reserves. </font>The transformation of the dollar from 
        a specified amount of precious metal to a fiat currency with no commodity 
        backing removed this limitation. The Fed could now legally counterfeit 
        the dollar producing as much of the paper currency as they wanted. We 
        will see later how this amounted to a huge hidden tax burden on the people. 
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Another way that the government allows the currency to 
        be legally counterfeited is through the system of <b>Fractional Reserve 
        Banking</b>, a practice which, like fiat currency, had originally been 
        considered fraudulent and illegal.</font> Rather than requiring that banks 
        keep enough money in their vaults to pay their depositors, should they 
        all demand their money at once, they were allowed to keep only a small 
        <b>fraction</b> in <b>reserve</b>. The assumption was that it would be 
        unlikely that everyone would demand their money at the same time. The 
        money which they were not required to keep in reserve could be loaned 
        out to earn interest, although it would also continue to appear in the 
        ledgers for the depositors as well, and thus new money was created not 
        by the printing press but by entries in the bank's ledgers. The people 
        who borrowed this new money would not need it all at once, so much of 
        it would end up back in the bank's vault, but again only a fraction of 
        that money would have to be held in reserve, and so the cycle could be 
        repeated over and over, multiplying the banks assets and the nation's 
        money supply many times over. <b>Some economists consider Fractional Reserve 
        Banking to be a system of legalized fraud which only comes to light when 
        the people lose confidence and make a run on the bank. </b></p>
      <p><font size="+1">In addition to printing new money, another way that the 
        government &quot;controls&quot; the money supply, and thus inflation, 
        is by the effect the prime interest rate has on the fractional reserve 
        system. </font>When the Fed lowers the interest rate there is more demand 
        for loans, since they cost less, and thus an increase in borrowing also 
        increases the money supply, as explained above. When the resulting inflation 
        appears to be getting out of control the Fed will raise interest rates, 
        decreasing the demand for loans and contracting the money supply. <b>By 
        emphasizing this role, the government portrays itself as an inflation 
        fighter. In reality the government is the cause of inflation! </b></p>

      <h4 align="left">How Does Counterfeiting Effect the Economy?</h4>
      <p><font size="+1">Counterfeiting has the immediate effect of increasing 
        the money supply, which is inflation. With more money in circulation, 
        there are more dollars chasing the same number of goods. This causes prices 
        to increase due to the law of supply and demand&#151;the supply remains 
        the same but the demand increases due to the additional money that is 
        available to buy them</font>. But it takes time for the additional money 
        to work its way through the system and effect the prices. The people who 
        benefit the most from the new money are the counterfeiters themselves, 
        since they are the first to spend the new money and the prices of the 
        goods and services that they buy have not yet increased. The next people 
        to benefit are the ones who receive the new money from the counterfeiters, 
        and so it goes down the line. By the time the money reaches the average 
        citizens, the prices of the goods and services that they buy have already 
        increased to reflect the additional new money that the counterfeiters 
        had introduced into the system, so they do not benefit from the new money 
        at all. In fact, it is the average citizens who ultimately pay the price 
        for the counterfeited money, because they have to pay higher prices for 
        all the goods that they purchase. The value of every dollar that they 
        own, including those which they had saved, has decreased in proportion 
        to the amount of new money that was introduced into the economy by the 
        counterfeiters. So in this way counterfeiting, or inflation, is a method 
        of transferring wealth from the average citizens to the counterfeiters, 
        and to the friends of the counterfeiters who were the first to receive 
        the new money.</p>

        it obscures the true cause of inflation.</font> As explained above, the 
        government likes to create the misconception that it is an inflation fighter. 
        But even a first year student of economics understands that the government 
        is in fact the cause of inflation. Most any dictionary will reveal that 
        the true definition of inflation is <b>&quot;an abnormal increase in available 
        currency and credit beyond the proportion of available goods, resulting 
        in a sharp and continuing rise in price levels.&quot;</b> (The American 
        Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition.) <u>Rising prices are not 
        inflation but a result of inflation</u>. The true cause is an increase 
        in money and credit. (Very recently some newer dictionaries have actually 
        changed their definition of inflation to &quot;rising prices.&quot; This 
        is ultimately a reflection of a &quot;new economics&quot; resulting from

        and Central Bankers have seized control of our money?</font> Prior to 
        1913, when the Federal Reserve was created, the purchasing power of the 
        dollar had essentially been unchanged for 125 years. But since the Federal 
        Reserve we have experienced nearly continuous inflation. As the Fed assumed 
        more and more control, and as the dollar's tie to gold and silver was 
        progressively loosened, inflation has continued to escalate. As a result, 
        since 1950 there has been an 88% decline in the dollar's purchasing power. 
        <b>In other words today's dollar is worth about 12 cents as compared to 
        a 1950 dollar!</b> In fact, the numbers have been so bad that the government 
        has begun falsifying the economic data. For example, in recent years they 
        have taken energy and food, two of the areas that have experienced the 
        highest rates of inflation, out of the formula they use to compute the 
        Consumer Price Index (CPI), the measure the government uses to report 
        inflation. This &quot;core rate,&quot; as they call it, is approximately 
        half the true rate of inflation. In recent years the Fed has also stopped 
        reporting the M3 money supply, the best measure we had of the new money 
        created by the government. The deception is obvious, but you rarely hear

        a U.S. silver three cent coin issued from 1851 to 1873. Most Americans 
        still think that our modern cents are made out of copper, but since 1982 
        they have been made out of zinc, a cheaper metal, and are only plated 
        with a very thin layer of copper. The U.S. government has debased the 
        dollar to the point where even this small zinc coin now contains more 
        than one cent's worth of metal, and so a ban has recently been issued 
        on the exporting and melting of pennies (and nickels as well) to prevent 
        people from profiting from the fact that their intrinsic value now exceeds 
        their face value! As inflation or debasement of our currency continues, 
        the one cent coin is destined for the same fate as the half cent and the 
        three cent silver trime, and even our copper-nickel coinage will eventually 
        have to be made smaller, or from a cheaper metal such as aluminum! <b>For

        supply to contract, and with less money chasing the same number of goods 
        the prices of those goods fell making them more competitive to foreigners. 
        The opposite happened in the country with the trade surplus. As gold flowed

        created, each dollar becomes worth less and less. In this way the government

        instruments. But there is an even bigger problem, which stems from the 
        fact that the U.S. dollar is the reserve currency for many foreign nations. 
        Our trade deficit has created a huge demand for dollars on the part of 
        foreigners. This demand has over the years been able to soak up many of 
        the excess dollars created by the Fed, and has also helped to keep inflation

        Today, all currencies are floating fiat currencies, and all governments 
        are inflating their currencies at record rates. </font>When one currency 
        depreciates, especially one as important as the U.S. dollar (the U.S. 
        is the world's largest consumer nation), the other nations depreciate 
        their currencies as well (by inflation) in order to maintain a competitive 
        position for their exports, which is necessary to keep their economies 
        afloat. So all of the world's currencies will go down together. (Recently, 
        one noted economist has accurately observed that all of today's currencies 
        are derivatives of the dollar.) But when all currencies are depreciating 
        together, how can one measure the value of any particular currency, since 
        the values of all currencies are floating in relation to one another? 
        It is like trying to measure something with an elastic ruler which can 
        expand and contract along with the objects that are being measured. The 
        answer lies in commodities, which are real things which governments can 
        not create out of thin air. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">As currencies all decline in unison, with the dollar 
        leading the way, they will appear to be relatively stable in relation 
        to one another. But the amount of commodities which those currencies will 
        buy will decrease. We see this as rising commodity prices.</font> Two 
        commodities in particular are very reliable indicators of the true value 
        of fiat currencies, and those are gold and silver, due to their monetary 
        role throughout history. That is why gold and silver are considered by 
        many to be the only <b>real</b> money. Since they reveal what governments 
        are really doing, gold and silver will forever remain a thorn in the sides 
        of governments that issue fiat currencies. That is why they are so despised 
        (and at times even demonized) by governments, and why central banks attempt 
        to manipulate the gold and silver markets to keep prices artificially 
        low. But they can not keep gold and silver prices down forever, because 
        the immutable law of supply and demand will eventually win out. When nations 
        decide to dump their dollars in favor of commodities, and real money, 
        there will be nothing that the central banks can do. The free market will 
        win in the end.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">People who have their wealth stored in fiat dollars, 
        and probably other fiat currencies as well, will see it disappear. </font>The 
        wise investors will have already diversified some of their money into 
        precious metals, and some will even benefit greatly from this disaster. 
        After an economic collapse, people will resort once again to the free 
        market which will determine the commodity that will serve as their money. 
        Many economists believe there is little doubt that the new currency will 
        be the same commodities that have served as money for thousands of years, 
        since even before written history. There is no reason to think that this 
        will ever change. Historically, the free market has decided that gold 
        and silver will serve as money. Will that be the case in the future? The 
        free market will decide.</p>

        fate of every fiat currency that has ever been created, without exception. 
        We only have to look at the historical record to see what it will be like.</font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Although it is not the most recent example, perhaps the 
        best known example is the hyperinflation of post World War I Germany.</font> 
        During the war Germany had borrowed heavily to pay its war costs. After 
        the war the Allies required her to pay huge reparation costs. The German 
        government, heavily in debt, decided to pay these massive obligations 
        by printing huge amounts of paper money with no backing by gold or silver. 
        By 1923 the greatest inflation in history was underway in Germany, with 
        prices often doubling in a few hours. Inflation was so bad that factory 
        workers were paid twice a day. During their lunch hours the workers' wives 
        would meet them at the factory gates to get their pay so they could spend 
        it before it lost its value. By late 1923 it took 200 billion Marks to 
        buy a loaf of bread! Many Germans who lived in the cities lost everything. 
        Those who lived in the country generally faired better, because some of 
        their wealth was stored in commodities such as land, equipment and food, 
        rather than in a fiat currency. Some Germans actually became rich during 
        this period because they had the foresight to put their wealth in gold, 
        silver and foreign currencies, thereby protecting it from the ravages 
        of inflation. They were later able to use their wealth to purchase businesses 
        for a fraction of what they were originally worth.</p>

        removed, the U.S. dollar has been inflated to the point where today it 
        is worth only 12 cents when compared to the 1950 dollar, and during that 
        same time the U.S. went from being the world's largest creditor nation

      Obama's misguided corporate and bank bailouts have resulted in billions

      creation and debt is waiting in the wings, because the velocity of money 
      (how quickly it is spent) has been drastically reduced by the recession. 
      But soon that velocity will catch up to the new money creation and its effects 
      on the value of the dollar will become apparent. And that is not all. Just 
      when we can afford it least, Obama's social programs, such as socialized 
      health care, promise nothing more than additional bureaucratic waste, more 
      governmental intrusion into our lives, and trillions of dollars of new debt 
      over the coming years. <b>Obama has made it perfectly clear that he is willing 
      to sacrifice the dollar in order to achieve his social agenda.</b> He believes 
      that the end will justify the means. But socialism did not work in Russia 
      and China and it will not work in America either. Will the USA suffer the

        Economic Crash Depression</font></h1>
      <p><font size="+1">The way to protect yourself is to put some of your assets 
        into commodities, such as gold and silver, with intrinsic value that can 
        not be taken away by government decree nor confiscated by inflation, by 
        buying from reputable dealers such as <a href="http://www.scoins.com" target="blank">scoins.com</a>. (Not an ad and I get no compensation when you buy from them. They are simply the best I have found in my area.) 
        </font>The value of gold and silver will always be determined by the open 
        market. Even if the government outlaws their possession, as it did with 
        gold in 1933, their value will be determined by the international market 
        or the underground market and they will most assuredly maintain their 
        valuable status as a medium of exchange and a safe haven and store of 
        value. </p>
      <p>Astute investment advisors have always recommend that a percentage of 
        your investment capital be kept in precious metals as insurance against 
        an economic disaster such as a stock market crash, hyperinflation, or 
        a collapse of the economy. Precious metals, particularly gold and silver, 
        have always served investors as hedges against inflation because they 
        typically move in the opposite direction as stocks and the dollar. When 
        currencies are decreasing in value (decreasing in buying power) precious 
        metals are nearly always increasing, and at the very least they will maintain 
        their value insuring that your capital is not eroded by inflation or a 
        falling dollar. </p>
      <p>The percentage usually recommended by investment advisors for your precious 
        metal safe haven is 10 to 15% of your investment/savings portfolio, but 
        that recommendation is always increased during times of economic uncertainty. 
        We have never lived in a time of greater economic uncertainty, so I recommend 
        that you consider putting 20% or more of your investment capital and savings 
        into precious metals. Furthermore, I recommend that you <u>take physical 
        possession of your precious metals and keep them in your possession</u>. 
        (Note: For safety, since I have become a high-profile survivalist writer, 
        I no longer store precious metals in or near my home. Your decision to 
        do so will depend on your personal preferences and circumstances.) The 
        government has confiscated the people's gold in the past, and that could 
        conceivably happen again. But they can not confiscate what they don't 
        know about nor get their hands on. But I believe that an even greater 
        danger during an economic crisis is the possibility that the institution 
        holding your precious metals could become insolvent, and you may find 
        it difficult or even impossible to get your hands on your precious metals 
        during the time of an emergency. </p>
      <p><b>What about mining stocks?</b> Certain stocks will no doubt benefit 
        from the bull market in precious metals. Commodity prices in general will 
        increase as a result of inflation and the resulting decline in the buying 
        power of fiat currencies, so it may be wise to shift some of your assets 
        toward these types of equities. But these should not be counted toward 
        the 20% or more that you may choose to put into precious metals that you 
        will take physical possession of as an insurance policy against uncertain 
        economic times. Buy the metals, not the paper! </p>

      <h3 align="left">Which Precious Metals Should You Buy?</h3>
      <p><font size="+1">I have spoken at great lengths about gold and silver, 
        but there are other precious metals (PM) that are also good safe havens 
        for your money</font>. The platinum group metals, particularly platinum 
        and palladium, also have a monetary history. All of the precious metals 
        have intrinsic value which will endure when fiat currencies fall. The 
        platinum group metals and silver have numerous industrial uses, particularly 
        in chemistry and electronics. All electronic equipment, including cell 
        phones and computers, contain some palladium, as well as gold and silver. 
        Platinum is used in many industrial processes including the refinement 
        of oil. Palladium is the preferred catalysts in catalytic converters for 
        gasoline engines, while platinum is the preferred catalysts for diesel 
        engines. Each precious metal has unique properties which will effect its 
        price movements in a technologically changing world, but all of them will 
        have a tendency to move in the opposite direction as fiat currencies, 
        which means that they will increase in value as fiat currencies fall. 
        The answer I believe is to diversify&#151;to hold some of each PM.</p>

        seeking a safe haven for their money. Platinum and palladium jewelry is

        in metals rather than numismatic premiums, I like these coins because 
        they can be purchased at prices just above their melt value giving me

      <p><font size="+1">Although diversification is a good idea, there will certainly 
        be some precious metals that you will want to hold more of than others. 
        I still think that gold and silver should make up the bulk of your PM 
        hoard. Between the two, I prefer to hold more silver than gold, although 
        both are available to buy from companies like <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/usmoneyreserve" target="blank">U.S. 
        Money Reserve</a> or Goldline. </font>The reason I like silver better 
        is because I believe that the percentage increase for silver will be greater 
        than the percentage increase for gold. In other words, during the time 
        that gold doubles in value, the price of silver is likely to increase 
        three or fourfold. I believe that, even considering the recent increases 
        in spot prices, both metals (and in fact all PM's) are currently undervalued, 
        but silver is the most undervalued. Throughout history the ratio of the 
        price for gold and silver has generally been around 16:1 (meaning that 
        one ounce of gold was worth 16 ounces of silver.) Today the ratio is about 
        50:1. After studying the PM market for years, I have come to the conclusion 
        that the 50:1 ratio is far greater than it should be. I believe that the 
        ratio will eventually be closer to 16:1 again. If the ratio returns to 
        16:1, that means that when gold is trading at $1,000 an ounce, for example, 
        silver should be trading at $62.50 an ounce. So silver would have to triple 
        or perhaps even quadruple in price, without the price of gold changing 
        a bit, before the 16:1 ratio is reached again. Imagine how much silver 
        will increase as gold doubles in value over the next few years as the 
        dollar continues its decline. I don't know if the 16:1 ratio will ever 
        be reached again, but clearly silver has the highest potential. I believe 
        that gold has a great potential, but the outlook for silver is fantastic!</p>
      <p><font size="+1">The fundamentals for silver, the data that investment 
        analysts use, have never been more bullish.</font> For the past 10 years 
        silver usage has exceeded mine output. As a result there has been a steady 
        draw down of silver inventories, which are now critically low. The U.S. 
        government, for example, used to stockpile huge amounts of silver, but 
        over the years it has gradually sold off its stockpile in order to keep 
        the spot price of silver artificially low. The government now has to buy 
        silver on the open market to keep its Silver Eagle bullion program going, 
        because its stockpile is completely gone. Low silver prices have slowed 
        investments in silver mining compounding the shortage. Silver is an industrial 
        metal that has numerous applications, particularly in the growing electronics 
        sector. It is also experiencing a huge demand from Eastern nations like 
        China and India, and as the economies of those countries continue to grow, 
        that demand will surely increase as well. Many analysts are saying that 
        silver is poised for a surge that will dwarf the great bull market of 
        1979-80, in which the spot price exceeded $50 an ounce. Adjusted for inflation, 
        the spot price of silver would have to reach nearly $150 today in order 
        to attain the same level that it reached back in 1980. But many believe 
        that silver is likely to exceed even that high. </p>

      that same dollar amount of any other precious metal. You can easily carry 
      $5,000 worth of gold or platinum in your pocket, but $5,000 worth of silver 
      would require a wheelbarrow! Silver will also take up more space in your 
      hiding place or safe. So you must decide, given your circumstances, how 
      much of each metal you will want to hold. The other side of that coin is 
      that silver is much more convenient for small transactions. Try to buy a 
      loaf of bread from your neighbor with a gold coin. They will probably have

      <h3 align="left">What Form of Precious Metals is Best to Hold?</h3>
      <p>As I have mentioned I believe that diversification is a good idea. You 
        may choose to hold various forms of all of the precious metals. But certain 
        forms will certainly have advantages over others. One thing that is important 
        to consider is <b>liquidity</b>&#151;the ease with which you can &quot;spend&quot; 
        your money, or convert it into cash. Liquidity will be highly related 
        to the recognizability of your precious metals. For example, if you have 
        a sterling silver ring that is marked as &quot;sterling&quot; or its equivalent 
        &quot;925&quot; (which means a fineness of .925, or 92.5% pure silver) 
        then it will be much easier to liquidate than a piece of jewelry with 
        no mark. If the item is not marked, the buyer will not know for sure if 
        it is 92.5% silver, or 90%, or 70%, or even if it is simply silver plated. 
        If its composition is known with certainty, then it will be a simply matter 
        of weighing the object and doing some simple math to determine its precise 
        value.</p>

      The U.S. Mint is particularly bad about charging high premiums for their 
      modern bullion coins, particularly the Silver Eagles (which usually carry 
      a premium of 30% or more above spot.) That is one of the reasons why my 
      favorite way to invest in silver bullion is with old U.S. silver coins. 
      The seigniorage was absorbed by the government years ago when the coins 
      were released for circulation, so these coins can usually be purchased in 
      circulated condition for very near their melt value. Uncirculated coins

      <p>Numismatics is the official term for &quot;coin collecting.&quot; Coin 
        collectors are often willing to pay high premiums, sometimes extremely 
        high premiums, for the coins they desire. Some investors, particularly 
        those who collect coins themselves, are also willing to pay high premiums 
        in the hope of receiving an even larger profit when they sell the coins. 
        Numismatics is a highly specialized field. It requires a tremendous amount 
        of specialized knowledge, particularly with regard to grading a coin's 
        condition. I have been a coin collector for many years, and I have studied 
        the field quite a bit, but I do not usually invest in numismatic coins 
        and I certainly do not recommend numismatic investments for the novice. 
        It is an area where you can very easily get seriously burnt. (Been there, 
        done that!) Unless you are a serious and experienced coin collector yourself, 
        I do not recommend that you pay the high premiums required for the purchase 
        of numismatic coins. For that reason, I recommend that you attempt to 
        pay near, or very near, the melt value of any bullion coins, round or 
        bars that you buy. </p>

        coins that I mentioned above are good examples of semi-numismatic coins, 
        because they are minted in small numbers and are popular with collectors. 
        I believe that semi-numismatic coins can be excellent investments, provided 
        you don't pay large premiums for them. Most modern coins, including the 
        Silver Eagles minted by the U.S. Mint, even though they are popular, are 
        minted in quantities that are much too high to ever be considered semi-numismatic. 
        Semi-numismatics is another area where you can get burnt if you don't

      <p>If you will always resist the temptation to pay high premiums for any

        save yourself a lot of heartache in the long-run. That is why I recommend 
        old circulated U.S. silver coins for your silver bullion investments. 
        (If you buy uncirculated coins, you will no doubt pay a premium.) For 
        gold bullion, any of the bullion coins that were minted by the official 
        mints of the various governments are perfectly fine. Gold bars manufactured

        you stick primarily with the coins.</p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">Disclaimer:</font></b><font size="+1"> All forms of 
        investment involve risk. Precious metals are no exception. There is no 
        guarantee that precious metal prices will continue to go up. But with 
        precious metals, unlike stocks and paper investments, there is a limit 
        to the downside risk.</font> When you are holding precious metals you 
        are holding something real, which historically has maintained a valuable 
        status since the beginning of civilization. Compare that to something 
        made out of paper which is intrinsically worthless! Many astute investors 
        believe that the best insurance for your investments is diversification: 
        &quot;Don't put all of your eggs into one basket,&quot; as my grandmother 
        used to say. I am not recommending that you put all of your money into 
        precious metals&#151;just a percentage, as an insurance policy. The percentage 
        you choose will depend on what you feel comfortable with, according to 
        how you view the economy and geopolitical events.</p>
      <p>Even during a prolonged bull market, the prices of precious metals will 
        fluctuate, sometimes wider than you may feel comfortable with. There will 
        be times when the spot prices will move lower and perhaps stay there for 
        weeks or even months. Many investors get &quot;shaken out&quot; of the 
        market during these times. Others see these &quot;pull backs&quot; as 
        buying opportunities and will add to their portfolios while the prices 
        are lower. I recommend that you take a long-term approach, adding regularly 
        to your precious metals portfolio while ignoring the many ups and downs. 
        For example, if you will buy a certain amount each month, as part of a 
        regular savings plan, you will be using a technique called <b>dollar cost 
        averaging</b>. The price you will end up paying each year will be approximately 
        the average spot price for that year. In the long run the ups and downs 
        that occurred along the way will not matter. Or you may chose to add to 
        your portfolio each time there is a pull back in the price. But be careful 
        because sometimes precious metals surge without warning, and if you were 
        not on board beforehand you will completely miss the big move. To keep 
        abreast of the fundamentals which effect all of the markets, including 
        the precious metals market, I recommend that you listen to Jim Puplava's

      <h4 align="left">Circulated U.S. Silver Coins</h4>
      <p><b><font size="+1">In summary, I believe that silver bullion is the best 
        investment, and circulated U.S. silver coins are the best way to invest 
        in silver bullion.</font></b><font size="+1"> </font>They have always 
        been very popular and universally recognized worldwide so they are possibly 
        the most liquid form of silver bullion available. The seigniorage for 
        the minting of these coins was absorbed by the government when the coins 
        were released into circulation years ago, so they can be purchased with 
        little or no premium. Your goal should be to buy your bullion at as close 
        to the current spot price of the metal as possible (and even below the 
        spot price if you are lucky enough to find such a deal.)</p>
      <p><font size="+1">U.S. silver dollars have always been the most popular 
        coin worldwide, for foreigners and Americans alike. As a result they will 
        almost always command a larger premium than other U.S. silver coins.</font> 
        You will probably be able to reclaim the premium when it comes time to 
        sell your coins, but you are not guaranteed to do so. Coin dealers love 
        to charge hefty premiums when they sell coins but they are notorious for 
        denying premiums when they buy them back from you. As a bullion investor, 
        as opposed to a numismatic investor, you should remember that your goal 
        is to purchase your bullion coins as close to the spot price as possible, 
        keeping any premiums to a minimum, so I advise you to stick with U.S. 
        silver coins of denominations other than the dollar; i.e., half dollars, 
        quarters and dimes. If you find an opportunity to buy silver dollars at 
        the spot price then by all means take advantage of it. If you ever find 
        an opportunity to buy uncirculated coins at the spot price you will want 
        to take advantage of that as well, but you will usually be buying circulated 
        coins if you are trying to keep your premiums to a minimum. Remember, 
        your goal is to invest in precious metals, not in collectibility or premiums.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">There are two basic kinds of circulated U.S. silver coins 
        that are traded as silver bullion: 90% silver coins and 40% silver half 
        dollars.</font> The 90% silver coins include all U.S. silver dollars, 
        half dollars, quarters and dimes dated 1964 and earlier. The 40% silver 
        coins include only the Kennedy half dollars minted from 1965 to 1970. 
        The 1970 Kennedy half was released only in mint sets for coin collectors. 
        No coins were released for circulation. Consequently, 1970 half dollars 
        are scarce and will carry a hefty premium of $10 or more. So for all practical 
        purposes this category of bullion coins will include only the dates 1965-1969. 
        The 40% halves have a couple of small advantages and one big disadvantage 
        over the 90% coins. They did not circulate long because their silver content 
        soon exceeded their face value and people began to hoard them soon after 
        they were released into circulation. As a result there was practically 
        no loss of silver from the coins due to circulation wear. Their other 
        advantage is that, similar to silver dollars, half dollars have always 
        been a very popular coins due to their large size. The disadvantage of 
        40% half dollars is their bulkiness. </p>
      <p>As we have seen, when compared to gold, silver has the disadvantage of 
        bulkiness and heaviness. A small amount of money buys a lot of silver! 
        This bulkiness is even greater when the silver contains other metals, 
        adding weight and size to the coins. The 40% half dollars are 60% copper. 
        So when you store your silver you are also storing a lot of copper as 
        well. As a result, the 40% half dollars are often discounted both when 
        you buy them and also when you sell them. You might be able to buy them 
        paying less per ounce of pure silver, but when you sell them you are also 
        likely to be paid slightly less per ounce of pure silver as compared to 
        90% silver coins.</p>

      <p>$1,000 face value bags of U.S. silver coins, as shown in the photograph 
        above, are one of the best ways to invest in silver bullion. They weigh 
        slightly more than 50 lbs. (23 kg) per bag. A $1000 face value bag of 
        40% halves contains 295 troy ounces of pure silver. A $1000 face value 
        bag of <u>un</u>circulated 90% silver coins contains 723.38 troy ounces 
        of pure silver; and a $1000 face value bag of <u>circulated</u> 90% silver 
        coins contains 715 troy ounces of pure silver. The reason the circulated 
        coins weigh slightly less is because a slight amount of silver has been 
        lost from each coin due to circulation wear. I recommend the circulated 
        coins because they can be purchased at very near the spot price of silver, 
        giving you the most silver for your money. You can also purchase these 
        coins in smaller quantities, by the $10 face value roll, for example.

      <h3 align="left">Where Should You Buy Your Bullion?</h3>
      <p><font size="+1">You can easily find your local coin and bullion dealers 
        by checking your phone book. Whether you are buying or selling, it pays 
        big to check around and compare the prices of the various dealers in your 
        area</font>. You may find great differences depending on the needs of 
        the dealers at any given time. For example, if they are overstocked in 
        the item that you are offering they will not be willing to pay you as 
        much. So get prices from all the dealers in your area before you buy or 
        sell anything. Like all businesses dealers are in business to make money, 
        and no one (other than the government) can make money by breaking even. 
        To meet their expenses and make a profit, dealers have to mark up everything 
        that they sell, and discount everything that they buy. You will always 
        pay more than the spot price for bullion when you buy from a dealer and 
        you will always be paid less than the spot price when you sell to them. 
        The percentage varies from dealer to dealer which is another reason why 
        you should shop around before making any transaction. But fortunately 
        there is now a way that you can avoid the dealer's fee. </p>
      <p>You can avoid the &quot;middle man&quot; and his or her fees by dealing 
        directly with the public through online auction sites like eBay. Prior 
        to the internet it was very difficult to find individual sellers and buyers 
        other than dealers. Today, dealing directly with the public online is 
        the usual way of conducting business. In fact, many dealers have found 
        that to survive they must also conduct some of their business online. 
        Private individuals and dealers alike are using the internet to make bullion 
        transactions creating a more level playing field for everyone. Shipping 
        and insurance charges will apply to most online transactions, but these 
        are more than made up for by the elimination of the middle man's exorbitant 
        fees. This increase in competition has forced online dealers to lower 
        their prices, but there is also less overhead for them to pay so they 
        can afford to do it. You would think that the increased competition would 
        also come into play when it comes time for you to sell your bullion online, 
        but this is offset by the vastly increased customer base. Buying and selling 
        coins and bullion online is a win-win situation for everyone involved.</p>
      <p>For the sake of completeness, I should mention that in addition to the 
        auction sites there are other good places to buy bullion online. You should 
        explore as many as possible to insure that you are getting your best deal. 
        Any reputable dealer, like the <a href="http://www.nwtmint.com/">Northwest 
        Territorial Mint</a>, will not only sell bullion to you, but will buy 
        it back, paying a fair price, as well. My personal favorite place to buy 
        is <a href="http://www.scoins.com" target="blank">scoins.com</a>. (Not 
        an ad and I get no compensation when you buy from them. They are simply 
        the best I have found in my area. Whether you buy from them or someone 
        else, be sure to download and print out their price sheet, which changes 
        hourly depending on spot prices, to do some comparisons to make sure that 
        where you are buying yours is giving you a fair deal.) </p>

      <h4 align="left">Buying Silver at Estate Sales</h4>
      <p><font size="+1">There is one other excellent place to buy silver that 
        I recommend if you have the time and the inclination to go &quot;treasure 
        hunting&quot; and that is estate sales.</font> An estate sale occurs when 
        an individual dies leaving an estate that the surviving family wishes 
        to liquefy, preferring cash over the individual's personal belongings. 
        Estate sales are usually fixed price cash and carry sales handled by professional 
        services and conducted in the deceased individual's home on a weekend. 
        The usual practice is to reduce the prices on the last day of the two 
        day sale, with most estate services cutting the prices of most items in 
        half on the last day of the sale, usually a Sunday. Generally everything 
        in the house is for sale, from kitchen spices to the living room furniture. 
        There is no end to the items that can be purchased at an estate sale. 
        The price is pennies on the dollar and there is no sales tax! Check the 
        classifieds section of your local newspaper, or the online version of 
        your local newspaper, to find the estate sales in your area. Once you 
        have the date, time and address, you can use an online map service like 
        <a href="http://www.mapquest.com">mapquest.com</a> to print a map to the 
        location. By carefully organizing our route, mapping the shortest route 
        from one estate sale to the next, we are able to visit 10 to 15 different 
        estates sales every weekend. We pack a picnic lunch and make it our weekend 
        outing thoroughly enjoying the &quot;thrill of the hunt.&quot; </p>
      <p>By visiting estate sales we have been able to greatly increase our standard 
        of living by purchasing almost everything that we buy paying pennies on 
        the dollar and avoiding sales taxes. We have even been able to buy fully 
        90% or more of our survival items at estate sales (including a lot of 
        canned foods.) But just as importantly, I have managed to buy a lot of 
        sterling silver at prices much lower than the spot price of silver. In 
        fact, it has not been unusual for me to purchase sterling silver items 
        at half their melt value! Often I can buy items on a Saturday or Sunday 
        that I could turn around and sell on eBay the following week&#151;doubling 
        my money! But I prefer to hold onto as much silver as I can because I 
        believe that the price of silver is going to soar with the continued decline 
        of fiat currencies, and I am hoping in time to increase my investment 
        tenfold. In addition, I am hoarding silver that I may be able to use as 
        money or barter during any economic collapse that may be in our future.</p>

      <p> 
      <p><font size="+1">There are a couple of things that you should be aware 
        of before you rush out to buy all the sterling that you can get your hands 
        on. </font>For one thing, remember that I am not recommending that you 
        purchase sterling silver at melt value, or spot price&#151;at least not 
        for an investment. If you want the item for your personal use and enjoyment 
        then paying melt value is a very good deal and an investment as well. 
        But if you are going to pay melt value for your silver investments you 
        should buy rounds, bars or coins, due to their greater convenience and 
        liquidity. I am recommended sterling as an investment when you can purchase 
        it below its melt value. This is often the case at estate sales but it 
        isn't always. I come across many sterling items at estate sales that I 
        pass on simply because the price is too high. (I will frequently put in 
        a bid for the item, offering slightly more than half its melt value, or 
        I might return the next day to see if I can purchase it at a discounted 
        price.) </p>
      <p><font size="+1">The other thing is to make sure that you are buying sterling 
        silver. Most silver items that you find at estate sales will be silver 
        plated. </font>These will have practically no silver value because they 
        consist mostly of a base metal, like copper, with an extremely thin layer 
        of silver covering it. Avoid silver plated items, unless of course it 
        is something that you want for your personal use. Never buy a silver-plated 
        item as an investment (unless you know for sure that you are buying a 
        valuable antique.) </p>

      <p>Sterling silver is always marked as sterling. It will either be stamped 
        with the word &quot;sterling&quot; on the bottom (as shown in my magnifying

      <p>By definition sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver, or has a fineness 
        of .925, which is abbreviated as 925 without the decimal. This is equivalent

      <p>Tableware, such as the baby fork shown above, and larger items are usually

        difficult to buy jewelry below melt value because there is a lot of workmanship 
        that goes into making it and there is a high demand for jewelry, so it 
        will nearly always command a high premium. But opportunities occasionally

      <p>Primarily you will be looking for larger items made out of sterling silver, 
        such as flatware (like that shown above), tea sets, bowls, trays, etc., 
        because these are the items that you will sometimes be able to purchase 
        below melt value or spot, especially if you go to the sale on the last 
        day when prices are generally reduced by as much as 50%. Each piece of 
        sterling will be clearly stamped with &quot;sterling&quot; on the back 
        or bottom. (There is an exception: Years ago some items were made out 
        of &quot;coin silver&quot; which, just like old U.S. silver coins, is 
        90% silver. These are usually stamped with the word &quot;coin.&quot;) 
        If it does not say &quot;sterling,&quot; &quot;925&quot; or &quot;coin&quot; 
        then always assume that it is silver plated. The two photographs below 
        show a variety of sterling items acquired from estate sales. (Note: For 
        safety, since I have become a high-profile survivalist writer, I no longer

        depend on your personal preferences and circumstances.)</p>

      <p><font size="+1">It will obviously help to have a scale to weigh the sterling 
        items that you come across. </font>I carry an inexpensive but highly accurate 
        battery-operated electronic digital scale the size of a pocket calculator 
        that easily fits in my shirt pocket. It allows me to weigh the item in 
        either grams, regular (avoirdupois) ounces or troy ounces. I weigh items 
        in troy ounces because it makes my calculations easier. (The spot price 
        of silver is always reported per troy ounce of pure metal.) Remembering 
        that sterling is 92.5% pure silver, it is an easy matter to multiply the 
        weight of the item in troy ounces by 92.5% or .925 to get the pure silver 
        content. This is multiplied by the current spot price to determine the 
        item's actual silver value or &quot;melt value&quot;&#151;the price you 
        would get if you were to melt it down and sell it at the current spot 
        price. (But don't worry, you will never have to melt it.) </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\scaleozt.jpg"><img src="img\scaleozt.jpg" width="512" border="0" alt="Digital pocket scale" height="342"></a></p>
      <p>My pocket digital scale is shown above with an unweighted (pure sterling) 
        salt shaker weighing about 2.1 troy ounces. Since sterling is 92.5% pure 
        silver I can simply multiply 2.1 x .925 to determine the troy ounces of 
        pure silver (1.94 ozt.) Then I can multiply 1.94 by today's spot price 
        to determine the exact melt value or spot price for this item. For example, 
        if today's spot price is $13.45, I multiply 13.45 x 1.94 to determine 
        that this sterling salt shaker has a melt value of about $26.00.</p>
      <p>If you use a scale that measures regular (avoirdupois) ounces you must 
        remember to convert the regular ounces into troy ounces before you compute 
        its melt value. A regular or avoirdupois ounce is equal to .91 troy ounces. 
        So to determine the melt value you would multiply its weight in regular 
        ounces by .91 x .925 by the current spot price of silver. (As a shortcut 
        you could simply multiply its weight in regular ounces by .84, the product 
        of .91 x .925, and then by the spot price.) Something else you should 
        know is that while a regular (avoirdupois) pound consists of 16 regular 
        ounces, a troy pound consists of 12 troy ounces. People rarely report 
        the weight in troy pounds, but this could be important to know if you 
        ever see an item advertised on a site such as eBay with its weight given 
        only in troy pounds. It would be easy to make the mistake of multiplying 
        the troy pounds by 16 to get the troy ounces, but your result would be 
        terribly inaccurate. You would need to multiply the troy pounds by 12

      be aware of before buying an item stamped as sterling is whether or not 
      the item is pure sterling or has a weighted bottom or is filled with cement 
      for reinforcement.</font> It is easy to tell the difference. A weighted 
      item will be stamped &quot;sterling&quot; on the bottom but it will also 
      be stamped with the words &quot;weighted&quot; or &quot;reinforced&quot; 
      or both. The important thing to keep in mind is that the total weight of 
      weighted or reinforced items is made up mostly of the weight or the reinforcement

    <td bordercolor="#CC3300" colspan="2"> <font size="+1">It is common to find 
      candelabras and compotes with weighted bottoms and reinforced stems.</font> 
      If you were to remove the sterling from the cement used to fill and reinforce 
      it you would find that the sterling makes up only about 8% of the item's 
      total weight. Weighted compotes are a little better with the sterling making 
      up closer to 25% of the item's total weight. Of course you will sometimes 
      find candelabras and compotes made out of pure sterling, but usually these 
      items are weighted and reinforced. Don't worry because you can easily tell 
      by looking at the bottom. Other items like salt shakers are also sometimes 
      found with a weighted bottom, while others (like the one shown on my digital 
      scale above) are pure sterling. The important thing to remember is to look, 
      and to make the correct estimate of the item's actual silver content. Sterling 
      flatware and most hollowware, including bowls, saucers, plates, gravy boats 
      and just about every other sterling item that you will find at an estate 
      sale, are almost always pure sterling. An important exception is the dinner 
      knives that come in flatware sets. The knives have stainless steel blades 
      and hollow sterling handles filled with reinforcing cement. The sterling 
      content of the knives is negligible, so when computing the sterling content 
      of flatware sets always exclude the knives. Obviously items made out of 
      pure sterling are more desirable than the weighted and reinforced items 
      because there is no guesswork as to their value. </td>

      <p><font size="+1">I have stated that silver and other precious metals are 
        the only real money. But are items made out of sterling, like flatware 
        and hollowware, really money?</font> In his excellent book, <i><a href="http://astore.amazon.com/thenewsurvivalist-20/detail/0945466447/102-1878054-3132968">What 
        Has Government Done to Our Money?</a></i>, the great economists Murray 
        N. Rothbard states, </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1" color="#000066">&quot;Since the commodity is the money, 
        it follows that the entire stock of the metal, so long as it is available 
        to man, constitutes the world's stock of money. It makes no real difference 
        what shape any of the metal is at any time. If iron is the money, then 
        all the iron is money, whether it is in the form of bars, chunks, or embodied 
        in specialized machinery. Gold has been traded as money in the raw form 
        of nuggets, as gold dust in sacks, and even as jewelry. It should not 
        be surprising that gold, or other money, can be traded in many forms, 
        since their important feature is their weight. It is true, however, that 
        some shapes are often more convenient than others.&quot; &#151;Murray 
        N. Rothbard</font></b></p>
      <p><font size="+1">According to Rothbard, <u>all</u> silver, regardless 
        of its form, is money</font>. Liquidity, of course, is another matter. 
        You can not walk into your local grocery store and buy a loaf of bread 
        with a sterling spoon. If your money is in the form of sterling, or even 
        in silver coins, you will have to undergo the inconvenience of taking 
        it to a dealer, or selling it through some other venue, to convert it 
        into a form of exchange that is acceptable at the store where you wish 
        to spend it. Cash is always the most liquid form of exchange. Even though 
        U.S. silver coins are only 90% pure silver, while sterling is 92.5% pure, 
        due to their convenience and desirability silver coins will probably always 
        be more liquid than sterling. The inconvenience of having to exchange 
        your silver for cash before you spend it is a disadvantage of storing 
        your wealth in silver. But in our current economic environment the advantages, 
        I believe, far outweigh the disadvantages. As the fiat currencies continue 
        to lose their spending power due to inflation, your silver will maintain 
        or increase its spending power. When the currency collapses (the fate, 
        remember, of all fiat currencies) then you will lose all of your money 
        if it is in dollars, while you will retain your wealth, and perhaps even 
        grow richer, if your wealth is preserved in the form of <u>real money</u>&#151;like 
        silver.</p>
