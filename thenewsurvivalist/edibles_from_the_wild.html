      <p><font size="+1">A few generations ago most people knew a lot about wild 
        edible plants. When European settlers first arrived in the New World they 
        found many plants which were unfamiliar to them. Discovering which ones 
        were good for food or medicines was a matter of survival. </font>The Native 
        Americans who had inhabited the continent for thousands of years had acquired 
        a lot of knowledge about the native plants, and the first European settlers 
        were eager to learn what they could from them. When Lewis and Clark made 
        their famous Westward expedition from St. Louis, one of their objectives 
        was to learn as much as they could from the natives about the indigenous 
        plants. Many plant samples were gathered throughout their journey and 
        brought back along with notes regarding their uses.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Unfortunately the average person today has almost no 
        knowledge of edible wild plants</font>. We have become so dependent on 
        the commercial food distribution system that we are not even aware of 
        the edible plants that commonly grow in our own yards. Fortunately we 
        do have something that Lewis and Clark did not have. There are many excellent 
        reference books available today that can help us identify edible plants 
        and provide instructions on how to use them. A few of these books for 
        North America are listed in the <a title="Additional Resources" href="survival_resources.html">Additional 
        Resources</a> section at the end of this web site and under &quot;Recommended 
        Reading&quot; at the bottom of this page. I suggest that you acquire a 
        good book for your location and begin now to learn about the plants that 
        are growing in your area. Don't wait until you are hungry!</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Most people are surprised when they discover how many 
        edible wild plants are growing within walking distance of their homes.</font> 
        In the remainder of this section, I will discuss only a few, which I give 
        as examples to illustrate just a tiny bit of the bounty that is available 
        for those who will do a little research and gain a little knowledge about 
        this important subject.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Two of my favorite examples are dandelion and plantain.</font> 
        I like to mention these because most people consider them to be the most 
        bothersome of weeds. Americans spend millions of dollars attempting to 
        eradicate these humble weeds, managing only to poison our streams and 
        lakes with the runoff from their deceptively immaculate lawns. When I 
        see a &quot;perfect&quot; green lawn, no doubt the pride of the homeowner, 
        I think about the dead stream nearby, where the toxic chemicals that have 
        drained from this &quot;perfect&quot; lawn, and others like it, have killed 
        off the fish and amphibians. This toxic stream then flows into a toxic 
        river which then flows into a toxic ocean. As a result of the chemical 
        fertilizers and herbicides that have been poured upon our lawns and fields 
        there is now a huge &quot;dead zone&quot; extending for miles out into 
        the Gulf of Mexico from where the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf. 
        What a price to pay for our immaculate lawns! I greatly admire a lawn 
        that supports a variety of plant species&#151;the way Nature intended!</p>

      <p>Dandelion is a member of the sunflower family. Its common name is derived 
        from the French <i>dents de lion</i>, meaning &quot;teeth of the lion,&quot; 
        so named because of the jagged edges of its leaves. Its botanical name, 
        <i>Tarazacum officinalis</i>, comes from the Latin for &quot;remedy for 
        disorders.&quot; It is native to Europe and naturalized in North America.</p>
      <p><font size="+1">Every part of the dandelion plant is edible.</font> The 
        young leaves are an excellent addition to a green salad. As the leaves 
        get larger they become bitter, so it is preferable to collect only the 
        small young leaves for salads, and the white leaves just below the surface 
        which have not yet turned green. Dandelion leaves or &quot;greens&quot; 
        can also be cooked like a vegetable, similar to spinach. Dandelion flowers 
        have been used to make dandelion wine, although they can be consumed raw 
        as well. The roots can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable; or roasted, 
        ground and brewed for a healthy coffee-like beverage. Dandelion root is 
        a tonic, so &quot;dandelion coffee&quot; can provide a mild stimulating 
        effect without the caffeine.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Nutritionists know the herb as one of the most nutrient-rich in the plant 
        kingdom. It contains potassium, sodium, phosphorus and iron. The leaves 
        are a richer source of vitamin A than carrots and contain some amounts 
        of vitamins B, C and D. Herbalists value the herb mostly for its benefits 
        for the urinary and glandular systems and as a liver and kidney tonic, 
        due to its ability to enhance the efficiency of the body's eliminative 
        and detoxifying functions. It is a mild laxative and diuretic. It has 
        traditionally been used as a tonic, blood purifier, for constipation, 
        inflammatory skin conditions, joint pain, eczema and liver dysfunction&#151;including 
        liver conditions such as hepatitis and jaundice. As a tonic dandelion 
        strengthens the kidneys and may be helpful for conditions such as water 
        retention and high blood pressure. It does not deplete the body of potassium 
        like many diuretics. </p>

      <p>There are nineteen kinds of plantain found in the U.S. Narrow-leaved 
        or English plantain (<i>Plantago lanceolato</i>), also known as ribgrass, 
        is shown above and common plantain (<i>P. major</i>) is shown below. Another 
        plantain not illustrated here is seaside plantain (<i>P. juncoides </i>or 
        <i>P. maritima</i>) also known as goosetongue. Plantains are found all 
        over the world and all are edible. They are also an important food for 
        wild animals and birds. </p>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\plantainbroadleaf3.jpg"><img src="img\plantainbroadleaf3.jpg" width="512" height="341" border="0" alt="Broad leaf plantain"></a></p>
      <p>Narrow-leaved or English plantain came to the New World with the settlers 
        from Europe. The Anglo-Saxons referred to it as the &quot;mother of herbs.&quot; 
        Like dandelion, the leaves should be collected when they are very young, 
        otherwise they will be too stringy. They can be eaten raw, used in a salad, 
        or cooked like greens. (Be careful not to overcook your wild greens.) 
        Herbalists value plantain for its astringent ability, resulting from its 
        high tannin content. Astringents help draw tissues together and stop bleeding. 
        Plantain has been used for cuts, burns, sores and for inflammation. It 
        has also been used to treat snake and insect bites. Plantains, as well 
        as dandelions, are also a favorite food of rabbits. If you decide to keep 
        rabbits, be sure to fatten them up on this abundant and free rabbit chow 
        from nature. (There is a type of green cooking banana that is also commonly 
        called plantain. It is not a true plantain and should not be confused 
        with the herbs mentioned above.)</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Cattails are clearly king with it comes to survival food.</font> 
        They are abundant, easy to identify, highly nutritious, found just about 
        everywhere, and some part of the plant is available and edible year round, 
        no matter the season. In the Spring the pollen can be collected by placing 
        a plastic bag over the flower heads. This can be added to flour, using 
        as much as 50% cattail pollen, and baked into bread. The Spring is also 
        the time to collect the green flower heads which can be cooked as a vegetable. 
        These must be collected before they start turning brown. In the early 
        Spring, the new shoots can be collected as they emerge from the soil and 
        cooked like asparagus. During any time of the year the roots can be dug 
        up and eaten as a vegetable. They can be sliced and boiled or steamed 
        as you would cook a potato or any other tuber. Cattails are not only highly 
        nutritious but delicious as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In this section, in an effort to whet your appetite, I have mentioned 
        only a few of the wild edible plants that are likely to be in your area. 
        Many other useful wild plants are described in the chapter on health care. 
        It is important for you to follow up on this information by acquiring 
        a field guide to the edible wild plants in your area. I have listed my 
        favorite ones in the <a title="Additional Resources" href="survival_resources.html">Additional 
        Resources</a> section at the end of this web site and under &quot;Recommended 
        Reading&quot; at the bottom of this page. This is required reading for 
        all survivalists! Don't just buy the book and put it on your shelf. Use 
        it as your bible to the great outdoors. Become proficient at identifying 
        plants and get familiar with the wild edible plants in your area. Collect 
        some edibles and try them! In the process you will be developing one of 
        the most important survival skills that you will ever acquire. Survivalism 
        consists of much more than just storing provisions for an emergency. Survivalism 
        is a life skill. Your food and water may be taken from you, but no one 
        can rob you of the knowledge and skills that you have stored in your head.

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_1A">Wild Game</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">Many types of wild game, both large and small, are readily 
        available for survivalists.</font> If you are a hunter or angler you are 
        well ahead of the game. (Pardon the pun.) You will already know how to 
        clean and butcher an animal. Even if you live in the city you will find 
        wild animals available for food. Rabbits, squirrels and pigeons are convenient 
        because they are small animals that will provide one family one meal with 
        few leftovers that need to be refrigerated or preserved. Deer are common, 
        even in the suburbs (where they can be surreptitiously harvested using 
        a bow or crossbow), but the problem with a large animal is that they will 
        provide a lot of meat, so unless you are feeding an army, there will be 
        a lot that will need to be preserved. During times of emergency there 
        may be no electricity to run your freezer. Meat can be preserved quite 
        well by pressure canning it in mason jars. It is also very easy to dry 
        and smoke it making jerky. We will discuss food preservation techniques 
        in a later section.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In a survival situation it is important that you do not put more effort 
        and energy into an activity than you get out of it. Survivalists writer, 
        Ragnar Benson, refers to this as the &quot;Rule of Survival Thermodynamics.&quot; 
        Hunting and fishing are two activities that take a lot of time and effort, 
        and unless you are assured of finding game in a short period of time, 
        they are usually not practical in an emergency situation. There is simply 
        too much to do, and you must not waste your time and energy in activities 
        that provide little hope of a sufficient return. For that reason, trapping 
        animals and setting out unattended fishing lines are far more practical. 
        Rather than wasting an entire day hunting or fishing, you can simple set 
        out your traps or fishing lines and go about your daily activities checking 
        on your traps and lines from time to time.</p>

      <p><font size="+1">Commercially-made traps are available, but one of the 
        best ways to trap small game is with homemade snares made from thin wire 
        or fishing line</font>. If you have seen the French movie, <i>Manon des 
        Source</i> (<i>Manon of the Spring</i>), you have seen wire snares at 
        work. Manon, the stunningly beautiful <i>sauvage</i>, uses homemade wire 
        snares to trap birds using dead insects for bait. Slightly larger snares 
        will work for trapping squirrels and rabbits. (More on suburban trapping 
        and snares can be found at <a href="http://www.survival.com/suburban.htm">http://www.survival.com/suburban.htm</a>.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>The simplest snare is made by creating a loop of wire with a slip knot 
        which allows the loop to tighten around the ensnared animal's neck, strangling 
        it as it tries to escape. The end of the snare is anchored to the ground 
        or a stationary object such as a tree or bush. Snares should be set out 
        where animals run, situated where the animal is likely to run through 
        the loop, which should be large enough for the animal's head to pass through 
        but too small for the body. </p>
      <p>Snares and traps can be dangerous because they do not discriminate. Pets 
        and even small children can become entrapped. If you use a snare, or any 
        other type of trap, be sure to adhere to the following important <b>&quot;trapper's 
        rules:&quot;</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li> If you kill it, you eat it! </li>
        <li> Be careful not to set traps where they may pose a hazard to pets 
          or people, especially children. </li>
        <li> Check your traps frequently. </li>
        <li> Always remove all of your traps when you no longer need them. </li>
        <li> Remember that a wounded animal can harm you. </li>
        <li> Don't eat diseased animals. </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="center"><a href="img\animaltrap2.jpg"><img src="img\animaltrap2.jpg" width="512" height="341" border="0" alt="Small animal trap"></a><br>
      </p>
      <p>The small animal trap pictured above is available in different sizes. 
        This smaller version is excellent for catching squirrels and rabbits. 
        The doors on both ends fall simultaneously when the animal hits the lever 
        in the middle where the bait is placed. The animal is captured alive and 
        unharmed, which is great if you want to fatten them up or start a rabbitry. 
        Domestic rabbits, such as the previously mentioned Florida Whites, are 
        much better for eating than their wild cousins, but any rabbits will do 
        in an emergency. </p>

      </h4>
      <p><font size="+1">Traps are a very efficient way of catching water animals.</font> 
        A fish trap consists of an enclosed cylindrical basket of wire or bamboo 
        with a conical or funnel shaped opening at one or both ends which extends 
        part way into the basket. The trap is submerged with bait inside. The 
        fish swim through the funnel shaped opening into the basket and once inside 
        can not get out. Anglers often use small fish traps, (see photograph below), 
        to catch minnows for bait. The size of the basket and the opening will 
        depend on the size of the fish you are trying to catch. Fish traps can 
        be easily made using chicken wire or hardware cloth. When using hardware 
        cloth choose a size that will allow smaller fish to pass through so they 
        can fatten up, retaining only the larger fish in your trap. Use road kill 
        for bait, or punch a lot of small holes in an unopened can of dog or cat 
        food.<br>

      <p><font size="+1"><b><font color="#000066">Skinning, cleaning and butchering 
        animals is a skill that all survivalists should know.</font></b> There 
        are good instructional videos available at hunting and outdoor stores. 
        I will briefly explain the procedure using a rabbit as an example. It 
        is the same procedure for a squirrel, or a rat, and essentially the same 
        procedure for larger animals. </font> 
      <p> 
      <p>I will assume you have trapped a rabbit in your snare and that it is 
        not yet dead. To kill the rabbit, hold it up by the hind legs with your 
        left hand, take the head in your right hand (reverse if you are left-handed) 
        and forcefully snap the head sharply back and slightly downward to break 
        its neck. Alternatively, you can give the animal a sharp blow to the back 
        of the head with a hard object, such as a hammer. (I prefer the latter 
        method.) Then use a sharp knife to cut the head off just below the skull. 
        Make small incisions between the Achilles tendons and the bones on both 
        hind legs and hang the animal upside down on hooks or nails through the 
        incisions to allow the blood to drain. Immediately make a cut on both 
        legs, all the way around the leg, between the ankle joint and Achilles 
        tendon being careful that you do not sever the tendons that you are using 
        to suspend the animal. Now make incisions, cutting through the fur and 
        skin but not into the muscles, from the first incision down the inside 
        of the legs to the genital area. Cut off the tail and join both incisions. 
        Pull the skin away from the muscles of the legs. Then slowly pull the 
        skin down and off the entire animal, turning it inside out as you go, 
        just as you would pull off a pullover sweater turning it inside out in 
        the process. When you get to the front legs cut off both front paws at 
        the first joint. Put the pelt aside if you plan on keeping it for tanning. 
        Now make an incision down the belly of the animal from the anus to the 
        ribcage being careful not to cut through any of the internal organs. Slip 
        the two first fingers of your left hand underneath the skin, carefully 
        cutting between your fingers, to keep from cutting through the intestines. 
        At this point the guts should practically fall out of the animal. Cut 
        away anything that is attached to remove the entire inner organs in one 
        mass. Save the kidneys and liver (carefully remove the gall bladder from 
        the liver), and clean out the rest of the animal. You can also save the 
        heart and the brains if you want. Clean the animal well, inside and out, 
        using cold water. If you have ice, cool the entire carcass down by submerging 
        it in ice water for a few minutes before butchering it. Cut the animal 
        up any way you like for cooking or preserving.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Save the fat! It could come in handy during a prolonged emergency. You 
        can use if for fuel, for waterproofing fabrics, for candle making, soap 
        making, and of course you can use it for cooking. Fat goes rancid very 
        quickly so it must immediately be rendered. (Rendered fat is known as 
        tallow, except rendered pork fat which is known as lard.) To render fat, 
        chop it up or grind it and heat it in a double boiler until it is a liquid. 
        Then pour it through fabric, or cheese cloth, until the liquid comes out 
        clean. You can pressure can the tallow or freeze it.</p>
