      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_0">Defending Yourself and Your Family After 
        a Disaster</h2>
      <p><font size="+2">Disasters often bring out the best in people. Unfortunately 
        they also brings out the worst.</font><font size="+1"> After any disaster, 
        whether local or widespread, there will be individuals intent upon creating 
        mischief. Lawlessness and disorder frequently become the rule of the day.</font> 
        While some individuals are lending their neighbors a helping hand, others 
        will be helping themselves. There will be looting, stealing and an increase 
        in acts of violence. Gang violence will become more common, even among 
        individuals who formerly took no part in gangs. The police will be overwhelmed, 
        so the responsibility will fall on the individual to provide protection 
        for self and family.</p>
      <p>Even a well-armed individual will be unable to hold out long if there 
        is a violent gang intent upon taking his or her possessions. Your chances 
        for survival will increase substantially if you are able to ban together 
        with your neighbors for your mutual defense. In our cities these days 
        it is unfortunate that neighbors can sometimes live side-by-side for years 
        without getting to know each other. As we will see in the chapter dealing 
        with the social aspects of survival, I recommend that you get to know 
        your neighbors and befriend as many as you can. Don't wait until a disaster 
        occurs. Do it now! Some day your life may depend on it.</p>
      <p>After a disaster the police may have their hands full in more ways than 
        one. History has shown that during any emergency there will be individuals 
        in law enforcement who will abuse their authority. In the months following 
        hurricane Katrina, 200 New Orleans police officers were disciplined for 
        various offenses, including looting, which were committed during the chaos 
        that enveloped the city after the hurricane. Four police officers were 
        indicted for first degree murder of unarmed individuals, including a 40-year-old 
        retarded man who was shot five times in the back. Three other officers 
        were charged with attempted murder. Two committed suicide.</p>
      <p>I do not mean to imply that all police are bad. The vast majority are 
        well-intentioned law abiding citizens who will risk their lives in order 
        to protect others. But there are always individuals in the police force 
        who will commit all sorts of crimes when the opportunity arises, and there 
        is no better opportunity than when chaos is widespread. There will also 
        be police officials who will think that they need and deserve your supplies 
        more than you do, and will therefore commandeer them for their official 
        or personal use. It will behoove you to lay low, keeping your activities 
        and provisions a secret from the police. In fact, keeping your supplies 
        a secret from everyone except your most immediate family is always a good 
        idea.</p>

      <h2 align="left" id="mbp_toc_1">Firearms</h2>
      <p><font size="+1">Amendment two of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the 
        right of the people to keep and bear arms. </font>But there is a wide 
        range of opinions these days regarding personal possession of firearms. 
        Regardless of your opinion, if there are individuals intent upon doing 
        you harm, and the police are unable to help you, your chances of survival 
        will improve if you are armed. Are you willing to risk the welfare of 
        your family to the whims of a marauding gang, or will you take steps to 
        protect the ones you love?</p>
      <p>This is obviously not an area where overkill is desirable. You would 
        not want to kill or severely injure someone unless it was absolutely necessary. 
        So I believe that your first line of defense should be pepper spray or 
        mace, or perhaps a Taser or stun gun. Everyone in your family should at 
        least carry pepper spray during dangerous times. They should also practice 
        using it. Pepper spray alone may be sufficient to drive off a lone individual 
        who is not too intent upon having your possessions. After all, he will 
        probably reason that there will be an easier target down the street, and 
        he will probably be right. A Taser or stun gun will be an even better 
        deterrent.</p>
      <p>If you can avoid it you will not want to get close enough to an offender 
        to use a stun gun or pepper spray. A BB gun or powerful air-soft gun that 
        shoots plastic BB's might prove to be another handy deterrent. It could 
        allow you to take care of problems from a greater distance than that required 
        to use your stun gun or pepper spray, and again without doing too much 
        harm. A BB will sting but it is not likely to pierce the skin. Avoid shooting 
        at the face or head, unless your intent is to do some damage. Perhaps 
        someone is stealing fruit from your trees. If a verbal warning doesn't 
        work, the sting of a BB on their leg or back might convince them that 
        you are serious. If the BB doesn't work, most likely the sound of a shotgun 
        fired into the air will do the job nicely.</p>

      <p>Unless you are an experienced gun owner, I do not recommend that you 
        purchase a firearm unless you also take a firearms or hunter's safety 
        class. Check at any location where guns or hunting licenses are sold for 
        information on the classes in your area. Everyone in your family who is 
        old enough to hunt or use a firearm should also take the class. Then you 
        should take your firearms to a practice range and become proficient with 
        their use. Always keep your guns and ammunition locked up and out of the 
        reach of children.</p>
      <p>Your survival supplies should include, not only the weapons mentioned 
        above, but plenty of ammunition as well. During a prolonged emergency, 
        ammunition might also serve as a useful item for barter, so don't fail 
        to stock up.</p>

      <p>If you have an intruder alarm in your home you will want to have a reliable 
        battery back-up that will work even when the electricity is off for an 
        extended period of time. If you do not have such a system a very effective 
        yet inexpensive alternative is to install wireless, battery operated Sonic 
        Alarms above each door and vulnerable window. </p>

      <p>Sonic alarms are easily installed with the self-stick tape backing included 
        on each unit. When the door is opened a magnetic switch activates the 
        device which emits an ear-piercing sound that is sure to startle any intruder 
        and awaken everyone in the house. Most intruders will immediately flee 
        the scene when they hear such an alarm so you will probably never see 
        them or have to confront them. If you do have to confront them it will 
        be on your terms, with your weapon in hand, which is far better than being 
        awakened in your bed with a gun at your head or a knife at your throat!</p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">&quot;Survival Doc, I just returned from the Appleseed 
          rifle shooting course</font> in Danville, IL. Thanks to your video about 
          your experieence with Applesed,</b> I clicked the link you provided 
          on Wednesday last week; called the name on the website on Thursday and 
          was lucky enough to attend the course that Saturday and Sunday. I drove 
          210 miles to get there, but it was well worth it. I had to bring my 
          dog, and the people at Appleseed were so gracious. I was able to tie 
          him up out of harms way, but close enough that I could see and hear 
          him.<b> I have never shot any type of gun in my life. In fact, I was 
          afraid to even touch a gun. Thanks to their excellent training I am 
          a good shot and now feel comfortable safely handling, loading and shooting 
          a rifle.</b>&quot;</p>
